00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:57.849
This is a story
only she and I know about.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.062
The story of the secret
of this world.

00:01:35.012 --> 00:01:38.682
It was like a pool of light.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.145
She ran out of the hospital.

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.325
Praying with all her heart,

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:41.411
she crossed the shrine gate.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.393
Fish?

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:23.245
Now I wonder if what I saw that day
was just a dream.

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:27.249
But, it wasn't.

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:31.753
That summer day,
up in the sky,

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:36.466
we changed the shape
of the world.

00:04:00.866 --> 00:04:03.785
I'M A 16-YEAR-OLD
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT

00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:10.792
We 're expecting
very heavy rain shortly.

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:12.878
It's gonna rain again.

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:14.796
I thought it had finally cleared.

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:19.718
We ran into a typhoon
on the island too.

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:21.136
Excuse me.

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.429
Sorry.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.558
For your safety,
please go back inside.

00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:43.909
Here it comes.

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:50.916
Wow!

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.830
Thank you.

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:34.167

I'M LOOKING FOR
A WELL-PAID PART-TIME JOB

00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:45.053
Sure you don't want any?

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:47.556
Yeah. I'm not hungry.

00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:50.851
Really?
Thanks for treating me.

00:05:50.976 --> 00:05:53.895
Don't mention it.
You saved me.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.982
Yeah. That was close.

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:01.820
Oh. Right.

00:06:02.988 --> 00:06:08.201
It's the first time
I saved someone's life.

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:09.870
OK.

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:13.623
By the way,
do they sell beer here?

00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:15.584
Shall I get you one?

00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:19.337

Why did you come to Tokyo?

00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:53.872
Er... To visit a relative.

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:57.250
Summer vacation
starts early at my school.

00:06:57.375 --> 00:06:58.376
Hmm.

No, sorry.

00:09:53.384 --> 00:09:54.886
Is he OK?

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:56.763
Leave him alone.

00:09:58.306 --> 00:10:00.767

It's for you. Don't tell anyone.

Huh? But, why?

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:30.106
You've eaten that for dinner
three nights in a row.

00:11:40.491 --> 00:11:42.827
I think that was

00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:47.957

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:05.892
Great! I found a nice café.
I'll book a table.

00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:08.645
See you, Nagi.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.521
Bye, Ayane.

A grade schooler...

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.905
How lucky.
I was hoping to see you.

00:12:20.114 --> 00:12:21.866
- Hi, Kana.
- Hello, Nagi.

00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:23.076
He's a ladies' man.

00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:25.828
- Did you curl your hair?
- Yes! What do you think?

00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:28.414
You look great.
Very lovely.

00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:01.823
Excuse me. I'm Morishima.
I called earlier.

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:04.242
Mr. Suga, are you in?

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.246

00:13:23.177 --> 00:13:25.138

00:13:31.853 --> 00:13:33.271
Huh? No, I haven't yet...

I'm Natsumi.
Nice to meet you.

Finally, someone else
to do the grunt work!

00:13:44.032 --> 00:13:45.283
Hey, kid.

00:13:45.575 --> 00:13:46.576
Yes?

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:50.288
You looked at my boobs.

00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:51.289
I didn't.

00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:55.501
What's your name?

00:13:55.626 --> 00:13:56.794
Hodaka Morishima.

00:13:56.919 --> 00:13:59.130
Hodaka. Beautiful name.

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:01.591
Are you employed here,
Natsumi?

00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:03.718
Wanna know about me and Kei?

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:06.054
- Um, yes.
- You're so funny.

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:09.307
It's like you think.

00:14:11.809 --> 00:14:13.019
Really?

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:15.813
I've never seen
a mistress before.

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:21.319
Long time no see, kid.
Have you lost weight?

00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:25.740
Don't tell me you went
out gambling again.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.245
You're looking
for a job, right?

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:34.082
This is what we're
working on now.

00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:37.835

- Any topic will do.

You kids like that kinda stuff, right?

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:02.276
- "Sunshine girl"?
- I'm like that!

00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:04.445
It's raining so much this year.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:07.240
- He ignored me?
- There's a demand for that.

00:15:07.365 --> 00:15:08.116
Right.

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:11.077
Come on, kid.
You've got zero initiative.

00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:14.455
She's got an interview appointment.
Go along and listen.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.124
Me? Now?!

00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:18.626
- You're on probation!
- "Probatory period."

00:15:19.127 --> 00:15:21.921
No, really. I can't.

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:25.633
Of course,
sunshine girls do exist.

00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:26.634
I knew it!

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:29.095
And also rain girls.

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:36.978
Excuse me?

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:41.649
Dragon god individuals drink a lot.
They yearn for water.

00:15:42.483 --> 00:15:45.403
They're strong-willed and competitive,
but a bit careless and unreliable.

00:15:45.736 --> 00:15:47.405
Maybe that's me.

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:52.285
Fox god individuals are hardworking,
but too weak-hearted to be leaders.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:53.369
Many are beautiful.

00:15:53.494 --> 00:15:54.412
Definitely me.

00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:59.750
The weather's off-balance, so more
sunshine and rain girls are born now.

00:15:59.876 --> 00:16:01.419
Homeostasis of Gaia theory.

00:16:01.544 --> 00:16:02.420
I see.

00:16:02.753 --> 00:16:04.922
But, we must be careful.

00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:09.135
Messing with nature
always has a cost.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.139
Whoever uses too much weather power
gets spirited away.

00:16:13.264 --> 00:16:14.182
That's...

00:16:15.516 --> 00:16:17.351
I'll be careful.

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:20.188
So, how was it?

00:16:22.064 --> 00:16:27.028
A so-called psychic talked at length
about fantasy novel-like stuff.

00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:28.863
"If you use too much power
you'll disappear."

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:30.406
I see. That kinda stuff.

00:16:30.531 --> 00:16:35.328
Weather isn't some kind of "power."
It's a natural phenomenon.

00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:40.541
Look, we're aware of that.
But, we're providing entertainment.

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:43.252
Is that all you've written so far?
You're slow.

00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:44.086
Sorry.

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:47.215
But it's not bad.

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:49.717
All right, you're hired.

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:51.719
Wait a minute!
I didn't say I was...

00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:53.221
It's a live-in job.

00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:56.182
- Meals included.
- Really?

00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:57.725
I'll do it!
Please hire me.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:00.895
Good.
What's your name again?

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.230
- Huh?
- Droll.

00:17:02.438 --> 00:17:04.232
- It's Hodaka.
- Right.

00:17:04.524 --> 00:17:05.441
It's ready.

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:07.026
Here.

00:17:07.735 --> 00:17:09.695
I'm underage, remember?

00:17:10.112 --> 00:17:12.740
Let's celebrate
Hodaka's hiring.

00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:15.785
Cheers!

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:23.251
That was the first meal I shared
with someone since I came to Tokyo.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.255
This is when my new life started.

00:17:40.142 --> 00:17:44.313
On that day, the wind suddenly
changed before our eyes

00:17:44.438 --> 00:17:48.067
That's when I knew
I could do most anything,

00:17:48.192 --> 00:17:52.280
like break the world record

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:56.701
with my weaker hand

00:17:56.826 --> 00:18:00.746
I did, I really did

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:05.251
It was a small editing company,
run by Mr. Suga and Natsumi.

00:18:05.376 --> 00:18:06.877
I did all the office chores.

00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:10.590
Starting from Mr. Suga's
personal care...

00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:14.135
Answering the phone, filing receipts,
transcribing interviews.

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.888
Is that all you've written so far?

00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:19.807
This isn't mine.

00:18:19.974 --> 00:18:21.642
Mr. Suga's out of the office...

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:28.774
Sometimes I rode around town
with Natsumi to do some interviews.

00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:33.571
If the world can easily
be changed by love

00:18:34.196 --> 00:18:37.199
nobody even cares to laugh

00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:41.370
What's the use of such a world?
I don't need it, not for me

00:18:41.495 --> 00:18:45.249
God, please show me
the next one now

00:18:45.374 --> 00:18:48.586
- They're looking for a sunshine girl.
- Hilarious.

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:53.716
My sis' friend's a real sunshine girl.
She calls her the day before a date...

00:18:53.841 --> 00:18:55.760
WEATHER
RESEARCH LAB
We're not interested.

00:18:55.926 --> 00:18:59.972
Then the weather balloon's videosonde
picked up something strange.

00:19:00.097 --> 00:19:03.017
A swarm of moving objects
among the cumulonimbi.

00:19:04.101 --> 00:19:06.020
Is that all you've written?

00:19:06.187 --> 00:19:07.772
You have to buy these
when they're on sale.

00:19:07.897 --> 00:19:09.273
He's out of the office...

00:19:09.482 --> 00:19:12.234
This paragraph's crap.
But this ain't bad.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.029
PACHINKO

00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:18.532
Mr. Suga, wake up.
Come on.

00:19:18.532 --> 00:19:21.702
Hello with no goodbye,
future with no resignation

00:19:21.869 --> 00:19:25.289
Heart with many doors
without any keys

00:19:25.414 --> 00:19:29.210
But, for the first time
someone was relying on me.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:29.752
I don't mind if the future
looks at us as if it knew

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:33.339
There is much more we can do
Those rainy days in Tokyo
passed in a flash.

00:19:33.339 --> 00:19:34.090
Those rainy days in Tokyo
passed in a flash.

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:38.969
We got plenty of miracles,
why don't we use them

00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:51.816
Rain.

00:19:52.566 --> 00:19:55.569
Rain. Rain. Rain.

00:19:56.779 --> 00:19:57.822
There you are.

00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:01.367
How's it going, Rain?

00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:04.078
Yeah? Good boy.

00:20:06.997 --> 00:20:09.959
It's an easy job.
You'll see.

00:20:10.084 --> 00:20:10.835
But...

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:16.590
Just give it a try.
You'll get paid right away.

00:20:16.841 --> 00:20:18.926
Our club is right there.

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:22.263
That girl...

00:20:27.351 --> 00:20:31.188
Give it a go
and earn yourself some bucks.

00:20:33.315 --> 00:20:36.193
It's right there.
Let's go!

00:20:38.821 --> 00:20:39.989
But...

00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:51.751
Let's go.

00:20:53.335 --> 00:20:56.338
Hey! Wait a minute.

00:21:02.219 --> 00:21:02.970
Wait!

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:06.015
- Just keep running!
- Listen to me.

00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:11.562
You brat!

00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:16.066
Hey, man.

00:21:16.525 --> 00:21:18.861
What do you think
you're doing?

00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:21.781
You were forcing her.

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:26.076
Are you dumb or what?
We've made a deal.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:30.831
Don't tell me...

00:21:31.582 --> 00:21:35.336
You're the brat that was
squatting in front of our club?

00:21:35.503 --> 00:21:38.339
What's this, payback?

00:21:38.714 --> 00:21:40.341
Please stop it.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.010
Damn!

00:21:44.136 --> 00:21:45.346
Get off me!

00:21:47.932 --> 00:21:49.850
What's that? A toy gun?

00:21:50.309 --> 00:21:52.353
You really are dumb.

00:22:16.919 --> 00:22:17.962
Get up.

00:22:42.653 --> 00:22:43.737
You...

00:22:44.864 --> 00:22:48.242
What was that for?
To thank me for that burger?

00:22:49.326 --> 00:22:52.246
Where did you get that gun?
Who are you?

00:22:52.413 --> 00:22:53.747
That's...

00:22:53.873 --> 00:22:58.294
I found it. I thought it was a toy.
It was like a lucky charm for me.

00:22:58.586 --> 00:23:03.257
What? You pointed it at someone.
You could have killed him.

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.928
I can't believe it! You make me sick.
You're the worst.

00:23:42.421 --> 00:23:45.966
I got fired from
my part-time job.

00:23:46.133 --> 00:23:47.676
Was it my fault?

00:23:47.801 --> 00:23:50.512
No, nothing to do with that burger.

00:23:50.638 --> 00:23:55.017
But, that's why
I need a well-paid job.

00:23:55.476 --> 00:23:57.978
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have...

00:24:04.735 --> 00:24:07.154
- Does it hurt?
- Not really.

00:24:09.281 --> 00:24:13.285
You're a runaway, aren't you?
I can tell.

00:24:13.494 --> 00:24:16.705
But, you can't enjoy Tokyo
with this rain.

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:18.666
Huh? Yeah.

00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:20.668
Come with me.

00:24:39.728 --> 00:24:41.939
It'll clear up now.

00:24:42.064 --> 00:24:43.023
Huh?

00:24:55.452 --> 00:24:57.705
What do you mean?

00:25:13.303 --> 00:25:14.221
A sunshine girl?

00:25:16.849 --> 00:25:18.267
I'm Hina.

00:25:18.392 --> 00:25:19.852
- What's your name?
- Hodaka.

00:25:19.977 --> 00:25:22.146
- How old are you?
- 16.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.898
Younger than me.

00:25:25.024 --> 00:25:28.986
I'll be 18 next month.

00:25:29.111 --> 00:25:30.738
You don't look it.

00:25:30.863 --> 00:25:32.740
You should treat me
with respect.

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:42.207
Pleased to meet you, Hodaka.

00:25:43.709 --> 00:25:44.710
Me too.

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:34.676
Mom, there's a fish.

00:26:34.802 --> 00:26:36.929
Yeah? Nice.

00:26:37.805 --> 00:26:39.473
Don't say bullshit.

00:26:39.598 --> 00:26:42.893
I'm serious. This way.

00:26:46.063 --> 00:26:47.356
Look. Over there.

00:26:48.732 --> 00:26:49.691
Can't see anything.

00:26:49.817 --> 00:26:52.486
It's there. Look harder.

00:27:05.541 --> 00:27:07.543
What's that?

00:27:23.267 --> 00:27:29.356
The Kanto region is experiencing
record-breaking rainfall this summer.

00:27:29.606 --> 00:27:32.985
It's been raining continuously
for two months.

00:27:33.152 --> 00:27:38.323
The 30 days forecast predicts
more heavy rain for another month.

00:27:38.323 --> 00:27:39.032
SUNSHINE FOR YOU

00:27:39.032 --> 00:27:41.827
The Meteorological Agency said
it's an extremely exceptional...

00:27:46.456 --> 00:27:48.542
Too expensive?

00:27:48.667 --> 00:27:49.501
Hey!

00:27:49.626 --> 00:27:52.129
Look, it's amazing.

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:55.632
SOME STUFF FELL DOWN
WITH THE RAIN

00:27:55.757 --> 00:27:57.134
IN THE PARKING LOT

00:27:57.259 --> 00:27:58.635
FAFROTSKIES

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.054
SEE-THROUGH
LIKE JELLY

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:06.226
They kinda look like fish.
They fell from the sky?

00:28:06.351 --> 00:28:08.854
But, they left no trace...

00:28:08.979 --> 00:28:10.480
They instantly disappear.

00:28:10.606 --> 00:28:11.523
Look.

00:28:15.819 --> 00:28:18.322
Remember what the guy
we interviewed said?

00:28:18.447 --> 00:28:21.575
The sky's a deeper
unknown world than the sea.

00:28:22.576 --> 00:28:25.913
A cumulonimbus can hold
as much water as a whole lake.

00:28:26.038 --> 00:28:29.666
So, it could as well harbor
an uncharted ecosystem.

00:28:29.791 --> 00:28:31.710
Like these fish?

00:28:31.835 --> 00:28:34.171
I guess. Amazing, isn't it?

00:28:34.713 --> 00:28:36.089
If we write about it...

00:28:36.715 --> 00:28:38.091
...maybe we can make
good money.

00:28:38.675 --> 00:28:39.593
Huh? What?

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:44.806
You're starting to sound like Kei.
You'll be a boring grown-up.

00:28:45.015 --> 00:28:48.018
Don't put off
your sunshine girl.

00:28:48.143 --> 00:28:50.479
- You're going on a date, right?
- It's not a date...

00:28:50.604 --> 00:28:52.606
I'm going to look for a job.

00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:54.608
What? Don't you work here?

00:28:54.733 --> 00:28:56.109
I'm just hanging out.

00:29:01.823 --> 00:29:04.284
It's not a date, I said.

00:29:05.577 --> 00:29:08.121
I understand how you feel,
Keisuke.

00:29:08.747 --> 00:29:12.626
But, she finally stopped
talking about you.

00:29:13.418 --> 00:29:16.129
It'd be cruel to meet her now.

00:29:16.546 --> 00:29:19.091
But, I have the fight to see her.

00:29:19.216 --> 00:29:22.636
Besides, you smoke.
Don't you?

00:29:23.178 --> 00:29:24.012
Huh?

00:29:24.221 --> 00:29:26.139
She's got asthma.

00:29:26.348 --> 00:29:28.141
You're too inconsiderate.

00:29:28.267 --> 00:29:31.603
I quit smoking a while ago.

00:29:31.728 --> 00:29:33.146
But...

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:36.066
You give a bad impression.

00:29:45.826 --> 00:29:47.869
It's raining all the time
this year.

00:29:48.078 --> 00:29:51.164
She can't play outside,
and it's bad for her asthma.

00:29:52.958 --> 00:29:55.419
I feel sorry
for children nowadays.

00:29:55.585 --> 00:29:58.922
We used to have
beautiful springs and summers.

00:30:11.351 --> 00:30:13.687
They can't live together
just the two of them.

00:30:13.812 --> 00:30:15.522
You're right.

00:30:22.195 --> 00:30:23.196
Hold on.

00:30:24.364 --> 00:30:26.366
So, possibly...

00:30:27.284 --> 00:30:30.245
I'm visiting a girl's home

00:30:30.912 --> 00:30:33.165
for the first time!

00:30:34.374 --> 00:30:36.460
Welcome, Hodaka.
You got lost, didn't you?

00:30:36.752 --> 00:30:39.546
No, er...
It's not much, but...

00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:43.050
Wow, thank you.
Come on in.

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:45.552
- Thank you.
- Sure.

00:30:47.512 --> 00:30:49.014
POTATO CHIPS

00:30:49.139 --> 00:30:49.931
INSTANT NOODLES

00:30:50.057 --> 00:30:51.767
Did you have lunch?

00:30:51.892 --> 00:30:54.478
Not yet.
But, it's OK.

00:30:54.728 --> 00:30:56.480
Sit there and relax.

00:30:56.897 --> 00:30:57.981
Can I use these?

00:30:58.315 --> 00:31:00.442
- Sure.
- Thanks.

00:31:13.622 --> 00:31:15.499
Do you live alone?

00:31:16.249 --> 00:31:19.002
With my younger brother.
We had some problems.

00:31:19.628 --> 00:31:20.921
Problems?

00:31:21.505 --> 00:31:24.049
How about you?
Why did you run away?

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:28.011
I found it suffocating
to live with my parents.

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:30.013
And in that town.

00:31:31.098 --> 00:31:32.015
I see.

00:31:40.482 --> 00:31:42.526
Shouldn't you go back?

00:31:44.277 --> 00:31:45.529
I don't want to.

00:31:46.488 --> 00:31:47.614
Right.

00:31:49.533 --> 00:31:51.535
Here you go.

00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:52.744
Wow.

00:31:52.869 --> 00:31:55.539
I forgot the spring onions!

00:31:58.708 --> 00:32:00.544
How do you like
living in Tokyo?

00:32:01.086 --> 00:32:02.546
Er... Oh.

00:32:02.712 --> 00:32:03.713
Come to think of it,

00:32:03.839 --> 00:32:06.133
I don't feel like
I'm suffocating anymore.

00:32:06.258 --> 00:32:08.051
Happy to hear that.

00:32:08.718 --> 00:32:10.053
Let's eat.

00:32:19.729 --> 00:32:21.565
What? An earthquake?

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:22.566
No, no.

00:32:22.858 --> 00:32:23.984
It's the train.

00:32:27.863 --> 00:32:29.823
Are you serious, Hodaka?

00:32:29.823 --> 00:32:31.074
SUNSHINE FOR YOU

00:32:31.074 --> 00:32:33.160
Well, you're a real
sunshine girl, aren't you?

00:32:33.493 --> 00:32:35.579
You can clear up the sky
just by praying.

00:32:35.704 --> 00:32:36.580
Yeah.

00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:38.999
Don't you need a job?

00:32:39.124 --> 00:32:42.085
I do.
But, I can't charge people for that.

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:46.715
I don't think you're cut out for
working in a club like that.

00:32:47.924 --> 00:32:49.217
Hodaka.

00:32:49.593 --> 00:32:50.844
What are you looking at?

00:32:50.969 --> 00:32:51.845
I'm not looking at anything.

00:32:52.345 --> 00:32:53.096
Sorry.

00:32:54.806 --> 00:32:57.100
Isn't $50 too expensive?

00:32:57.309 --> 00:33:00.020
Shall we do $30, then?

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.607
Considering living
expenses, though...

00:33:03.732 --> 00:33:05.275
Maybe we need some graphics.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:06.943
I'll draw them.

00:33:07.736 --> 00:33:09.946
What's this? A hippo?

00:33:10.071 --> 00:33:12.449
- It's a frog.
- Seriously?

00:33:14.201 --> 00:33:15.076
It's done!

00:33:15.202 --> 00:33:20.123
SUNSHINE FOR YOU

00:33:21.166 --> 00:33:23.293
I'd like some sardines...

00:33:25.045 --> 00:33:25.879
Who are you?

00:33:26.004 --> 00:33:29.132
You're the boy on the bus!

00:33:29.841 --> 00:33:31.259
Do you know each other?

00:33:31.384 --> 00:33:33.512
Hodaka, this is
my brother Nagi.

00:33:33.637 --> 00:33:37.098
Nagi, this is Hodaka.
He's my business partner.

00:33:37.224 --> 00:33:38.141
REQUEST

00:33:38.308 --> 00:33:40.060
We've got a request!

00:33:40.185 --> 00:33:41.603
You've already uploaded it?

00:33:41.728 --> 00:33:44.981
They want good weather
for a flea market.

00:33:45.106 --> 00:33:46.149
It's tomorrow.

00:33:46.608 --> 00:33:49.110
Wait a minute!
Am I really gonna do this?

00:33:49.236 --> 00:33:50.946
Widespread rain tomorrow...

00:33:51.071 --> 00:33:52.489
It's gonna rain tomorrow.

00:33:52.614 --> 00:33:54.157
That's the whole point.

00:33:54.616 --> 00:33:56.076
Who the hell is that guy?

00:33:56.201 --> 00:33:58.286
It'll be fine. I'll help you.

00:33:58.411 --> 00:33:59.913
How?!

00:34:03.291 --> 00:34:05.418
Please use this.

00:34:11.216 --> 00:34:12.133
Sorry, I won't.

00:34:12.259 --> 00:34:15.178
I've got another
secret weapon for you.

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.522
Sorry, don't need it.

00:34:25.647 --> 00:34:27.732
Cut it out, Hodaka!

00:34:29.651 --> 00:34:32.237
Who called those weirdos?

00:34:32.362 --> 00:34:35.532
We thought it might
bring good luck.

00:34:40.495 --> 00:34:43.623
Don't push yourselves
too hard.

00:34:43.748 --> 00:34:45.834
We're almost there!

00:34:45.959 --> 00:34:47.252
Water, Hina?

00:34:47.377 --> 00:34:48.712
Do you want a candy?

00:34:49.796 --> 00:34:51.965
- Tell them to go home.
- OK.

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:54.217
- The sky's clearing up.
- No way!

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:08.231
- It cleared up.
- It's been ages, huh?

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.734
- Look! Look!
- Finally, after so long.

00:35:11.192 --> 00:35:14.237
- The sky's so beautiful.
- Amazing.

00:35:14.779 --> 00:35:15.739
What do you think?

00:35:16.031 --> 00:35:19.200
- You're awesome, guys.
- You're a real sunshine girl.

00:35:19.326 --> 00:35:22.245
- I'm so surprised.
- You're great.

00:35:22.537 --> 00:35:25.248
- Even if it was a coincidence.
- It wasn't.

00:35:25.373 --> 00:35:27.250
Here's $200.

00:35:27.375 --> 00:35:28.293
It's too much.

00:35:28.418 --> 00:35:31.171
You get a bonus
because you're cute.

00:35:31.296 --> 00:35:35.759
Thank you so much.
We'll sell a lot more now.

00:35:44.684 --> 00:35:45.769
Yaay!

00:35:46.311 --> 00:35:48.438
- Amazing!
- I feel I can do this.

00:35:48.563 --> 00:35:50.732
Cool! Let's make money
with the weather.

00:35:50.857 --> 00:35:52.025
Yeah!

00:36:08.166 --> 00:36:13.296
With no song to listen to,

00:36:13.713 --> 00:36:18.093
my day starts in blue

00:36:20.011 --> 00:36:20.929
REQUEST

00:36:21.054 --> 00:36:26.101
But you came along saying
Good morning, so flamboyantly

00:36:26.101 --> 00:36:26.434
ON MY WEDDING DAY

00:36:26.559 --> 00:36:30.897
And changed everything -
how strange life is

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:38.321
Your words, probably,

00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:43.118
as they say in movies

00:36:43.243 --> 00:36:45.620
The human mind
works in mysterious ways.

00:36:45.995 --> 00:36:50.792
Are like catchphrases
in the climax,
You just need to see the sun shining
in the morning to feel energized.

00:36:50.959 --> 00:36:54.504
A blue sky makes you feel
happy you're alive.

00:36:54.504 --> 00:36:56.047
And I love them

00:36:56.047 --> 00:36:58.216
It makes you feel more in love
with that someone by your side.

00:36:58.675 --> 00:37:02.137
It's a once in a lifetime event.
I wanna wear white under a blue sky.

00:37:02.262 --> 00:37:03.805
To watch the meteor shower.

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:06.391
It never wins on rainy days!

00:37:06.516 --> 00:37:09.269
I've worked hard in that sweatshop
just for today!

00:37:09.394 --> 00:37:11.229
I want to play outside.

00:37:11.855 --> 00:37:14.399
LANTERN CEREMONY
AT ASAKUSA FESTIVAL
Everyone had their own reason
to pursue sunshine in rainy Tokyo.

00:37:14.399 --> 00:37:16.901
Everyone had their own reason
to pursue sunshine in rainy Tokyo.

00:37:17.026 --> 00:37:20.989
Hina was able to clear only
small spots for a brief time.

00:37:21.114 --> 00:37:24.242
But, the sky would always
answer her prayers.

00:37:24.367 --> 00:37:27.787
She was really
the "100% sunshine girl."

00:37:27.954 --> 00:37:31.166
There's no meaning

00:37:31.416 --> 00:37:34.210
if you're not around

00:37:34.335 --> 00:37:37.380
Stop being too serious,

00:37:37.505 --> 00:37:40.467
don't ask me why

00:37:40.633 --> 00:37:43.636
My list goes on, list of reasons

00:37:43.636 --> 00:37:47.390
It was like the whole town
was dressing up.

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:51.519
Here's the 2020th reason why

00:37:51.519 --> 00:37:52.520
What a wonderful world
I was born in, I thought.

00:37:53.271 --> 00:37:54.856
My list goes on, list of reasons
Smile, please.

00:37:54.856 --> 00:37:56.357
My list goes on, list of reasons

00:37:56.357 --> 00:37:56.900
Go! Go! Keep going!

00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:59.402
Why it has to be you

00:37:59.402 --> 00:38:01.404
Kawaii...kawaii...

00:38:01.404 --> 00:38:04.115
Make a guess What's on
the top of my list

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.116
Thank you.

00:38:05.241 --> 00:38:06.117
Thanks.

00:38:06.242 --> 00:38:09.245
- Thanks.
- Thank you so much.

00:38:09.496 --> 00:38:12.582
We 're really influenced
by the weather.

00:38:13.208 --> 00:38:18.087
I realized how much the human heart
is connected with the sky.

00:38:20.757 --> 00:38:22.008
THERE'S MISO SOUP IN THE POT.
H.

00:38:23.218 --> 00:38:24.552
I'm off.

00:38:28.223 --> 00:38:29.766
To where?

00:38:32.852 --> 00:38:35.730
TERROR ALERT

00:38:35.855 --> 00:38:38.441
- Is it canceled due to rain?
- It's past noon.

00:38:38.566 --> 00:38:39.734
When does it start?

00:38:39.859 --> 00:38:41.152
TELL US WHAT'S
GOING ON
I've changed my clothes
to come here.

00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:41.861
I've changed my clothes
to come here.

00:38:41.861 --> 00:38:43.112
THEY'LL CANCEL IT

00:38:43.321 --> 00:38:44.781
LET'S MAKE A
GOOD WEATHER CHARM
I'm tired.

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:50.453
I've read online that
the "100% sunshine girl" is amazing.

00:38:50.578 --> 00:38:55.834
But, this is such a big event.
Do you really want to rely on that?

00:38:55.959 --> 00:39:00.463
It's going to rain all week.
We won't be able to postpone it.

00:39:00.755 --> 00:39:05.093
In this situation, we're even
ready to rely on a charm.

00:39:51.764 --> 00:39:54.058
The Jingu Gaien fireworks

00:39:54.183 --> 00:39:57.353
will start at 7 p.m.
as scheduled.

00:40:34.891 --> 00:40:36.643
I'm in love.

00:40:37.977 --> 00:40:40.647
With this sunshine girl job.

00:40:41.314 --> 00:40:45.151
I finally found
my role in life.

00:40:45.902 --> 00:40:50.573
Maybe. Or maybe not.
Or maybe not not.

00:40:50.698 --> 00:40:53.493
Maybe not not. . .?

00:40:53.618 --> 00:40:54.786
Yes or no?

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:57.914
You're too serious.

00:40:58.456 --> 00:41:01.751
Thank you, Hodaka.

00:41:07.548 --> 00:41:10.176
Weather is a mystery.

00:41:10.551 --> 00:41:14.973
The way the sky looks
can move you so much.

00:41:15.431 --> 00:41:20.228
Hina really moves my heart.

00:41:37.704 --> 00:41:43.209
Yesterday's Jingu Gaien fireworks
were blessed with miraculous sunshine.

00:41:43.334 --> 00:41:47.171
COMPANY TYPE
But, strong rain is back again today,
just like a backlash.

00:41:47.296 --> 00:41:49.716
YOUR STRENGTHS
The temperature in the capital
is now 70°F, much lower than average.

00:41:49.716 --> 00:41:51.509
The temperature in the capital
is now 70°F, much lower than average.

00:41:51.634 --> 00:41:54.053
It's unusually chilly for August.

00:41:54.303 --> 00:41:56.222
Make sure you wear a light jacket...

00:41:56.347 --> 00:41:57.515
You're my first
company of choice.

00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:58.850
You're my first
company of choice.

00:41:58.975 --> 00:42:01.894
You're my first
company of choice.

00:42:02.145 --> 00:42:05.022
I ADMIRE SKILLED
AND CHARMING PEOPLE
Be careful not to
catch a cold.

00:42:05.022 --> 00:42:06.899
I ADMIRE SKILLED
AND CHARMING PEOPLE

00:42:06.899 --> 00:42:09.402
Record rainfall and low temperatures
are driving food prices up.

00:42:09.694 --> 00:42:13.906
Lettuce is three times
more expensive than last year.

00:42:18.244 --> 00:42:22.415
Oh, that project?
Right, we've put it on hold.

00:42:22.415 --> 00:42:24.584
THE SUNSHINE GIRL IS
THE WILL OF GAIA

00:42:24.584 --> 00:42:24.917
Sorry, we 're not
going ahead with it.

00:42:25.334 --> 00:42:26.711
I see.

00:42:26.961 --> 00:42:27.712
Yes. OK.

00:42:27.837 --> 00:42:30.923
I'll do my best, so
please call us again.

00:42:41.601 --> 00:42:42.518
What?

00:42:56.157 --> 00:42:57.950
Hello, this is the Mamiya household.

00:42:58.075 --> 00:43:01.954
Hello, it's Keisuke.
Sorry to rush you.

00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:03.539
Regarding the visit...

00:43:05.124 --> 00:43:08.252
You're late, Kei.
It's an important interview.

00:43:09.295 --> 00:43:12.173
Are we in a bad mood?
No luck with work?

00:43:12.298 --> 00:43:13.299
Where's Hodaka?

00:43:15.218 --> 00:43:16.761
Busy with his other job?

00:43:16.886 --> 00:43:19.305
SUGA HODAKA

00:43:19.597 --> 00:43:22.433
Just let him be.
We're not that busy.

00:43:22.558 --> 00:43:24.519
He took in that cat.

00:43:24.644 --> 00:43:25.812
You did the same with him.

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:26.771
Huh?

00:43:26.896 --> 00:43:29.315
You helped him because
he reminded you of yourself.

00:43:31.818 --> 00:43:35.404
How much are you paying him?

00:43:35.863 --> 00:43:38.407
Only $300? That's so low.

00:43:38.533 --> 00:43:41.327
- Nope. It's $30.
- What?

00:43:41.911 --> 00:43:44.789
Are you serious? $30 a month?
That's exploitation.

00:43:44.914 --> 00:43:45.623
Look ahead.

00:43:45.748 --> 00:43:50.837
You're gonna get sued.
Actually, I'll report you.

00:43:51.128 --> 00:43:56.843
He gets free food and accommodation,
and the company pays his phone bills.

00:43:57.134 --> 00:43:58.344
Ugh!

00:43:59.804 --> 00:44:02.265
No wonder he's got
an extra job.

00:44:04.684 --> 00:44:08.312
I'm surprised.
It's really cleared up.

00:44:08.896 --> 00:44:12.733
You kids are amazing.
It's a shame you're quitting.

00:44:12.859 --> 00:44:13.818
She was caught on camera.

00:44:13.943 --> 00:44:16.028
THE WEB FAMOUS
SUNSHINE GIRL?
We got flooded with requests.

00:44:16.028 --> 00:44:16.821
THE WEB FAMOUS
SUNSHINE GIRL?

00:44:16.946 --> 00:44:22.869
We can't cope. We'll do a last one
then stop for a while.

00:44:23.661 --> 00:44:26.831
She looks tired, too.

00:44:28.374 --> 00:44:30.126
Got guests, Granny?

00:44:30.251 --> 00:44:31.377
Oh, you're here.

00:44:31.961 --> 00:44:33.379
I came to help.

00:44:33.963 --> 00:44:37.341
Very young guests.
Are you Granny's friends?

00:44:37.466 --> 00:44:38.384
Hello.

00:44:38.759 --> 00:44:41.637
I've asked for nice weather on
my husband's first anniversary.

00:44:41.762 --> 00:44:44.849
It stopped raining, in fact.

00:44:52.148 --> 00:44:55.610
It'd be hard for him to come back
if it was raining.

00:44:55.735 --> 00:44:56.777
"Come back"?

00:44:56.903 --> 00:45:00.907
They say the dead come back
from the sky around August 15.

00:45:01.532 --> 00:45:05.369
So, he died a year ago?

00:45:05.494 --> 00:45:06.412
Yes.

00:45:06.537 --> 00:45:08.915
My mom too.

00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:13.419
You lost your mother
last year?

00:45:14.128 --> 00:45:14.879
Yes.

00:45:15.004 --> 00:45:18.424
Light a welcoming fire
for her.

00:45:18.549 --> 00:45:20.927
She'll protect you.

00:45:21.469 --> 00:45:22.345
Thanks.

00:45:26.849 --> 00:45:30.937
He'll follow the smoke
and come back.

00:45:31.604 --> 00:45:32.688
From where?

00:45:32.855 --> 00:45:34.440
From heaven.

00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:39.278
There's always been
another world, up in the sky.

00:45:43.741 --> 00:45:47.954
Apparently, this is what
the Weather Maiden saw.

00:45:48.287 --> 00:45:50.039
It's a mysterious painting.

00:45:50.164 --> 00:45:52.750
Flying fish in the sky.
And even a dragon.

00:45:52.875 --> 00:45:54.210
It's beautiful.

00:45:54.585 --> 00:45:56.170
Right?

00:45:56.295 --> 00:46:00.216
The "Weather Maiden" was
like a shaman, right?

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.510
Huh? What?

00:46:02.635 --> 00:46:05.221
Was she like a shaman?

00:46:05.805 --> 00:46:06.973
Yeah.

00:46:08.307 --> 00:46:12.478
Fixing the weather is
the Weather Maiden's work.

00:46:12.853 --> 00:46:15.606
- Fixing it?
- Sounds like a con.

00:46:15.731 --> 00:46:19.110
Like this year's abnormal weather?

00:46:19.235 --> 00:46:22.613
There's nothing abnormal about that.

00:46:23.239 --> 00:46:28.744
They say "in recorded history,"

00:46:28.995 --> 00:46:31.580
but when did records begin?

00:46:31.706 --> 00:46:33.249
100 years ago at best.

00:46:33.374 --> 00:46:36.252
How old do you think this is?

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:37.837
800 years old.

00:46:37.962 --> 00:46:38.754
800?

00:46:40.089 --> 00:46:42.258
Don't get too excited, Grandpa.

00:46:45.261 --> 00:46:48.639
The weather changes on a whim.

00:46:48.764 --> 00:46:50.766
Regardless of human needs.

00:46:50.891 --> 00:46:53.853
We can't even tell
what's the norm and what isn't.

00:46:53.978 --> 00:46:57.148
We're only allowed to stay temporarily

00:46:57.273 --> 00:47:00.860
in the space between
the sky and earth,

00:47:00.985 --> 00:47:04.864
clinging hard not to be shaken off.

00:47:04.989 --> 00:47:09.452
We used to be well aware
of this in the past.

00:47:10.745 --> 00:47:16.625
But, there's a thin thread
linking us humans and the sky.

00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:20.254
The Weather Maiden.

00:47:20.254 --> 00:47:22.965
I PRAY FOR
GOOD WEATHER

00:47:22.965 --> 00:47:26.802
A special girl who can take in people's
wishes and deliver them to the sky.

00:47:27.553 --> 00:47:33.476
In ancient times, there was one
in every village and every country.

00:47:33.601 --> 00:47:35.811
Kei.
It sounds like the sunshine girl.

00:47:35.936 --> 00:47:39.273
Are you sure you want
to listen to my grandpa?

00:47:39.398 --> 00:47:41.484
It all sounds pretty far-fetched.

00:47:42.359 --> 00:47:45.529
It's a very interesting story.
We're thankful.

00:47:45.654 --> 00:47:50.326
But, everything comes
at a price.

00:47:51.327 --> 00:47:56.582
A tragic fate awaits
the Weather Maiden.

00:47:57.416 --> 00:48:00.336
TACHIBANA

00:48:00.336 --> 00:48:01.921
One, two, three.

00:48:02.338 --> 00:48:04.340
Your turn.

00:48:05.299 --> 00:48:06.967
One, two, three.

00:48:07.093 --> 00:48:09.345
Thanks for keeping
Granny company.

00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:11.806
We're actually here
because of work.

00:48:11.931 --> 00:48:13.599
Join us, Granny.

00:48:14.683 --> 00:48:17.686
They're having fun.
How old are you guys?

00:48:17.812 --> 00:48:20.106
I'm 16. She's...

00:48:22.024 --> 00:48:24.902
She said it's her
birthday next week.

00:48:25.027 --> 00:48:27.613
Really? You've gotta
buy her a present.

00:48:29.615 --> 00:48:31.700
Come eat some watermelon.

00:48:31.826 --> 00:48:34.120
- Yaay!
- Thank you.

00:48:39.208 --> 00:48:41.127
Hey, wait!

00:48:49.093 --> 00:48:50.553
Dang.

00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:56.976
Jeez. Why?

00:48:58.978 --> 00:49:00.146
Wait a minute.

00:49:15.953 --> 00:49:20.040
I didn't know she was
a minor, I swear.

00:49:21.417 --> 00:49:23.627
It's not about that?

00:49:23.752 --> 00:49:25.963
I told you it wasn't.

00:49:26.088 --> 00:49:28.132
You made us run for nothing.

00:49:28.465 --> 00:49:30.342
That's you, right?

00:49:32.052 --> 00:49:35.681
Can you tell us
about this boy?

00:49:38.851 --> 00:49:41.687
A high school boy?

00:49:41.896 --> 00:49:45.983
Maybe he picked up by chance
the gun Shibata threw away.

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:50.196
In that case, he might
have posted about it.

00:49:52.156 --> 00:49:53.657
Online, you mean?

00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:57.703
Kids write all sorts of stuff
on social networks nowadays.

00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:05.252
WHAT'S THE BEST BIRTHDAY
PRESENT FOR AN 18 Y/O GIRL?

00:50:05.377 --> 00:50:06.712
POSTED

00:50:09.298 --> 00:50:10.591
4 ANSWERS

00:50:11.467 --> 00:50:13.219
DON'T ASK ONLINE

00:50:15.512 --> 00:50:17.389
Go, Nagi!

00:50:17.806 --> 00:50:20.226
- You're amazing, Nagi!
- You're the best.

00:50:23.938 --> 00:50:25.731
A ring. Definitely.

00:50:26.023 --> 00:50:28.859
Really?
Isn't it too serious?

00:50:28.984 --> 00:50:31.111
It's for my sister's
birthday, right?

00:50:31.237 --> 00:50:34.240
I've asked another woman
for reference, but...

00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:36.075
What I'd like to get?

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:37.826
Hugs and kisses. Cash.

00:50:37.952 --> 00:50:39.995
A decent boyfriend. And a job.

00:50:40.704 --> 00:50:42.873
It wasn't helpful at all.

00:50:43.582 --> 00:50:45.125
- A ring...
- Bye bye, Nagi.

00:50:45.251 --> 00:50:46.502
- See you, Nagi.

00:50:48.295 --> 00:50:50.506
You're in love
with Hina, aren't you?

00:50:50.756 --> 00:50:51.507
What?

00:50:51.632 --> 00:50:53.801
Er, it's not like that.

00:50:53.926 --> 00:50:56.011
Or maybe it is?

00:50:56.345 --> 00:50:59.515
Being ambivalent
is the worst thing for a man.

00:51:00.057 --> 00:51:01.350
Really?

00:51:01.475 --> 00:51:06.021
Be clear before you start dating
and be ambiguous later. It's the basics.

00:51:08.148 --> 00:51:10.526
Can I call you Nagi Sempai?

00:51:13.529 --> 00:51:17.241
Hina's been working all the time
since Mom died.

00:51:17.366 --> 00:51:22.079
She's been doing it for me,
because I'm still a kid.

00:51:23.414 --> 00:51:27.167
So, I want her to do more
teenage-like stuff.

00:51:27.293 --> 00:51:29.795
I don't know if you're
the right guy, though.

00:51:32.381 --> 00:51:34.300
Thank you very much.

00:51:37.386 --> 00:51:41.307
Er, do you think
she'll like it?

00:51:41.598 --> 00:51:42.474
Huh?

00:51:43.934 --> 00:51:46.562
It took you three hours
to choose it.

00:51:46.979 --> 00:51:49.315
If it were I,
I'd be very happy to receive it.

00:51:50.065 --> 00:51:51.483
I wish you the best of luck.

00:51:54.653 --> 00:51:59.074
LONGEST RAIN SPELL
RECORD BROKEN

00:52:00.326 --> 00:52:05.748
A man requested good weather
at the park for his daughter.

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:10.669
After that,
I'll give Hina the ring.

00:52:22.097 --> 00:52:24.933
Daddy, do it again.
One more time!

00:52:25.184 --> 00:52:27.436
Right. Ready?

00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:29.271
Go!

00:52:32.733 --> 00:52:35.944
Ow.
This is bad for your back.

00:52:36.362 --> 00:52:40.491
Why you, Mr. Suga?
Did you know this was my job?

00:52:40.616 --> 00:52:44.953
You knew and said nothing?
Actually, you have a daughter?

00:52:45.496 --> 00:52:49.458
I'm stunned.
Today's forecast was 100% rain.

00:52:52.002 --> 00:52:54.380
My daughter has asthma.

00:52:54.671 --> 00:53:00.219
She lives with her granny, who
won't let me see her on rainy days.

00:53:01.136 --> 00:53:03.972
Nothing can beat
a gorgeous blue sky.

00:53:04.098 --> 00:53:06.892
So, you're Hodaka's boss.

00:53:07.017 --> 00:53:09.436
I also saved his life.

00:53:09.561 --> 00:53:11.605
Why does she treat you
like a little boy?

00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:14.483
Hina's two years older than me.

00:53:14.608 --> 00:53:17.945
Huh? 16, 17, 18.
Same stuff.

00:53:18.070 --> 00:53:19.446
- I guess.
- It's not.

00:53:19.571 --> 00:53:20.739
There you are!

00:53:21.156 --> 00:53:23.242
Hi, guys!

00:53:23.659 --> 00:53:27.204
Aren't you gonna be
in trouble?

00:53:27.413 --> 00:53:29.998
Does Natsumi know
you're married?

00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:32.501
What's up with you guys?

00:53:36.296 --> 00:53:39.508
Hodaka thought
you were my...

00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:41.176
Mistress?

00:53:42.469 --> 00:53:45.639
You didn't tell me
you were uncle and niece.

00:53:45.764 --> 00:53:48.058
That's a disgusting fantasy.

00:53:48.183 --> 00:53:49.518
You're dirty-minded.

00:53:50.561 --> 00:53:52.229
Hey, Hodaka.

00:53:56.233 --> 00:53:57.359
You looked at my boobs.

00:53:57.484 --> 00:53:58.527
I didn't!

00:53:58.819 --> 00:54:00.529
Natsumi!

00:54:00.737 --> 00:54:02.489
Hello, Moka!

00:54:02.614 --> 00:54:05.492
Daddy, I made a garland.
It's for you.

00:54:05.617 --> 00:54:07.035
Really?

00:54:07.286 --> 00:54:08.537
Come here, Hodaka.

00:54:08.954 --> 00:54:10.998
My sempai's calling me.

00:54:13.083 --> 00:54:14.668
Hodaka's hilarious.

00:54:14.793 --> 00:54:16.378
He's such a kid.

00:54:17.296 --> 00:54:20.257
Don't you think
they're similar?

00:54:20.382 --> 00:54:22.050
- Hodaka and Mr. Suga?
- Yep.

00:54:22.176 --> 00:54:25.804
Kei ran away from home and came
to Tokyo when he was a teen.

00:54:25.929 --> 00:54:28.807
He met his future wife
and fell in love big time.

00:54:29.892 --> 00:54:33.187
But, she died in an accident
some years ago.

00:54:33.312 --> 00:54:35.564
He's still in love with her.

00:54:37.649 --> 00:54:40.819
I've been dying to meet you
for so long, Hina.

00:54:40.986 --> 00:54:43.864
The 100% sunshine girl.
You're amazing.

00:54:43.989 --> 00:54:47.910
I wish I had a skill like that on my
resume. I hate looking for a job.

00:54:48.035 --> 00:54:49.745
I wish I was still
in high school too.

00:54:50.537 --> 00:54:54.583
I can't wait to be
a grown-up instead.

00:54:56.376 --> 00:55:00.506
Right.
Good to see you're OK.

00:55:01.048 --> 00:55:03.091
I was actually a bit worried.

00:55:12.309 --> 00:55:15.812
Are you tired, Moka?
Here, take a breath.

00:55:15.938 --> 00:55:18.023
One, two, three.

00:55:19.858 --> 00:55:21.485
I'm fine. Let's play!

00:55:21.610 --> 00:55:22.361
I don't think...

00:55:23.070 --> 00:55:25.739
I guess we'll leave now.

00:55:25.864 --> 00:55:29.034
I want to spend
more time with Nagi!

00:55:29.159 --> 00:55:31.411
Why don't we all go
to dinner together?

00:55:31.537 --> 00:55:32.371
But...

00:55:32.496 --> 00:55:35.791
I'll go eat with Moka.
Is it OK?

00:55:35.916 --> 00:55:37.501
- Sure.
- Yaay!

00:55:37.626 --> 00:55:39.378
Hodaka, take Hina home.

00:55:41.255 --> 00:55:42.047
Hey.

00:55:44.216 --> 00:55:47.803
Thank you for bringing
the sunshine today!

00:55:49.221 --> 00:55:50.055
Thank you.

00:55:50.514 --> 00:55:52.975
I'm glad I made you happy.

00:56:07.531 --> 00:56:12.327
Oh my god. Oh my god.

00:56:14.288 --> 00:56:17.332
So, possibly
this is gonna be...

00:56:17.457 --> 00:56:20.502
...the first time I tell
a girl I love her.

00:56:28.969 --> 00:56:30.596
- Hina.
- Hodaka.

00:56:30.721 --> 00:56:32.222
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

00:56:32.431 --> 00:56:34.891
- What is it?
- Nothing in particular.

00:56:35.058 --> 00:56:36.643
What were you saying?

00:56:40.439 --> 00:56:43.108
Hodaka, you know...

00:56:46.361 --> 00:56:47.571
I...

00:56:57.914 --> 00:56:58.665
Hina!

00:57:04.963 --> 00:57:06.173
Hodaka!

00:57:06.423 --> 00:57:07.591
Hina?

00:57:36.411 --> 00:57:38.455
I think I became
a sunshine girl...

00:57:39.706 --> 00:57:42.834
...last year, on that day.

00:57:51.093 --> 00:57:55.222
I prayed for good weather
all day long the day before.

00:57:55.722 --> 00:57:59.226
I wanted to have one last walk
under the sun with my mom.

00:58:05.315 --> 00:58:08.735
It looked like a pool of light.

00:58:09.194 --> 00:58:12.656
Praying with all my heart,
I crossed the shrine gate.

00:58:26.294 --> 00:58:29.214
When I came around,
I was lying on the roof floor.

00:58:29.715 --> 00:58:31.341
And the sky was clear.

00:58:39.975 --> 00:58:41.226
I think

00:58:42.185 --> 00:58:46.022
that's when I got
connected to the sky.

00:58:51.570 --> 00:58:54.656
Connected to the sky?

00:58:57.367 --> 00:58:58.994
Stay in there, Hodaka.

00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:03.999
Police.
Sorry for the late visit.

00:59:04.416 --> 00:59:05.500
The police?

00:59:05.959 --> 00:59:08.003
Are you sure
you've never seen him?

00:59:08.712 --> 00:59:13.049
He's been seen many times
around here.

00:59:13.842 --> 00:59:14.760
I don't know him.

00:59:16.011 --> 00:59:17.429
What has he done?

00:59:17.554 --> 00:59:20.140
We want to ask him
some questions.

00:59:20.265 --> 00:59:25.270
He's a runaway. His parents
filed a missing person's report.

00:59:26.188 --> 00:59:31.318
Also, you're living alone
with your little brother, right?

00:59:31.443 --> 00:59:32.277
That's right.

00:59:32.402 --> 00:59:35.030
That's a bit of a problem too.

00:59:35.614 --> 00:59:37.616
Without a guardian, you...

00:59:37.741 --> 00:59:38.533
But!

00:59:39.034 --> 00:59:42.037
We don't bother anyone.

00:59:45.415 --> 00:59:46.583
Hina.

00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:51.296
She'll come back tomorrow
with the social service.

00:59:51.588 --> 00:59:54.299
What can I do?
They'll separate us!

00:59:55.634 --> 00:59:58.553
MR. SUGA

01:00:08.396 --> 01:00:10.482
Hodaka! The police were...

01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:13.527
I know.
Go home, I'll come later.

01:00:13.652 --> 01:00:16.905
Temperatures have fallen
sharply after sunset.

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:18.365
Mr. Suga?

01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:20.075
Surprised by my new look?

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:22.077
I'm in disguise.

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:28.583
The police came to my office.
They're treating it like a kidnapping.

01:00:29.584 --> 01:00:32.379
I denied any involvement,
but they suspect me.

01:00:33.505 --> 01:00:35.757
Take it. It's your severance pay.

01:00:36.424 --> 01:00:40.720
Don't come back to the office.
They'll arrest me.

01:00:43.515 --> 01:00:49.229
I filed for custody of my daughter.
It's a delicate time, sorry.

01:00:50.605 --> 01:00:53.108
Go back home tomorrow.

01:00:53.692 --> 01:00:55.986
Then everything will
go back to normal.

01:00:56.862 --> 01:01:00.574
It'll be best for everyone.

01:01:02.033 --> 01:01:04.202
It's time to grow up, kid.

01:01:13.712 --> 01:01:16.131
We can't stay here anymore.

01:01:16.256 --> 01:01:18.216
But, where are you...

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:20.677
I don't know, but...

01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:22.262
Anywhere will do.

01:01:22.387 --> 01:01:23.722
As long as I'm with you.

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:29.311
Hodaka, you'd better go home
before you get caught.

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:31.563
You've got a place
to go back to.

01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:33.231
Don't say that.

01:01:35.567 --> 01:01:37.235
We'll be fine.

01:01:39.279 --> 01:01:41.239
I'm not going back.

01:01:42.574 --> 01:01:43.742
Let's run away together.

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:54.544
A heavy rain special warning has
just been issued in the Tokyo area.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:58.256
It could be the heaviest
rainfall in decades.

01:01:58.506 --> 01:02:01.009
Watch out for floods
in lowland areas...

01:02:01.176 --> 01:02:03.511
A sudden typhoon-strength
low-pressure system...

01:02:04.179 --> 01:02:07.974
River flooding.
Increasing danger.

01:02:08.099 --> 01:02:09.768
Hey, it's overflowing!

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:12.729
Keep calm and walk slowly
towards the exit.

01:02:12.854 --> 01:02:16.733
Namboku Line Akabane-Iwabuchi Station,
Shibuya Metro Station...

01:02:16.858 --> 01:02:19.778
Several flights canceled
at Haneda Airport.

01:02:19.986 --> 01:02:24.991
Over 6 inches of rain in an hour.
Heavy flooding in many areas of Tokyo.

01:02:25.116 --> 01:02:29.537
EVACUATION ORDER
Kita Ward, Arakawa Ward,
Taito Ward, Sumida Ward, Shibuya Ward.

01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:31.539
You may get stranded.

01:02:32.457 --> 01:02:34.000
It's really cold, isn't it?

01:02:34.125 --> 01:02:36.252
RAIN FALL RANGE
AND INTENSITY
It's unusually cold
for August.

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:39.005
RAINFALL RANGE
AND INTENSITY

01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:41.132
HEAVY RAIN SPECIAL WARNING
Cumulonimbi keep gathering
above Tokyo...

01:02:41.132 --> 01:02:45.053
HEAVY RAIN SPECIAL WARNING

01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:49.140
A heavy rain special warning
has been issued in the Tokyo area.

01:02:49.265 --> 01:02:52.060
The low-pressure system over
the Kanto region...

01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:55.689
Because of a stream of cold air over
Kanto, very unstable weather...

01:02:55.814 --> 01:02:59.025
More heavy rain in central Japan
even after dawn...

01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:03.113
This abnormal weather
will continue for a few weeks.

01:03:03.238 --> 01:03:07.075
This abnormal weather is unprecedented
and extremely dangerous.

01:03:13.164 --> 01:03:18.336
IKEBUKURO
TRAIN DELAYS

01:03:18.336 --> 01:03:21.423
Due to transportation delays,
Yamanote Line trains are suspended.

01:03:21.548 --> 01:03:23.008
What the heck?

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:25.885
- Let's get off.
- I'll ask Mom to pick us up.

01:03:26.011 --> 01:03:26.761
It's freezing.

01:03:26.886 --> 01:03:28.263
What should we do?

01:03:28.388 --> 01:03:31.349
Let's look for a place
to sleep tonight.

01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:35.854
I'm sorry,
we're fully booked.

01:03:36.104 --> 01:03:37.605
Do you have a reservation?

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:39.107
We're full.

01:03:39.232 --> 01:03:40.608
Only the three of you?

01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:43.069
Do you have ID?

01:03:43.194 --> 01:03:44.863
LOVE HOTEL
We can't accept unaccompanied minors.

01:03:44.988 --> 01:03:46.614
It's not a matter of money.

01:03:47.198 --> 01:03:48.616
It's no place for kids.

01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:52.078
You guys...

01:03:52.203 --> 01:03:54.414
Are you runaways?

01:04:02.797 --> 01:04:05.133
Hina, Hodaka. Look!

01:04:05.925 --> 01:04:07.218
Snow?

01:04:35.747 --> 01:04:37.457
COLD DRINK

01:04:48.009 --> 01:04:54.432
MIDSUMMER SNOW

01:05:01.439 --> 01:05:06.027
Hina is connected
with the sky...?

01:05:18.832 --> 01:05:20.458
It's freezing!

01:05:22.085 --> 01:05:24.462
Hey Kei,
it's snowing in August.

01:05:25.171 --> 01:05:27.590
The world's finally
gone crazy.

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:29.968
Oh?

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:33.680
It's unbelievable, but
it's snowing here in Tokyo.

01:05:33.805 --> 01:05:36.224
Kei, wake up.
You'll catch a cold.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:38.476
Asuka.

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:44.732
Asuka. You too, Kei.
Smile.

01:05:46.568 --> 01:05:47.735
HEATER

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:51.739
Brr.

01:05:51.906 --> 01:05:55.118
You look like
an old man, Kei.

01:05:55.243 --> 01:05:57.245
You know,
once you grow old

01:05:59.205 --> 01:06:02.750
you can't switch
your priorities anymore.

01:06:04.043 --> 01:06:06.504
What are you saying?
Where's Hodaka?

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:09.632
You kicked him out?
I can't believe it!

01:06:09.757 --> 01:06:14.804
I told you, the police showed up.
I've got to protect myself.

01:06:14.929 --> 01:06:19.267
So, you smoked a pack of cigarettes
and got drunk because you felt guilty.

01:06:19.601 --> 01:06:21.769
That's so uncool, meow.

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:23.771
Even Rain's saying it.

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:28.985
Really uncool. So last century.
Can you stay away? You smell old.

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:33.031
You're uncool too.
What's her name... Hina?

01:06:33.281 --> 01:06:35.783
If the story about the
Weather Maiden being...

01:06:36.451 --> 01:06:39.120
...a human sacrifice is true,
then one day she'll...

01:06:39.537 --> 01:06:40.788
But, that's...

01:06:41.122 --> 01:06:43.291
What should I have done, then?

01:06:43.416 --> 01:06:46.294
Don't get so uptight.
It's just bullshit.

01:06:47.629 --> 01:06:49.756
But, if it was true...

01:06:53.718 --> 01:06:59.307
If you could fix this crazy weather with
one human sacrifice, I'd be happy.

01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:02.810
Everyone would.

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:08.024
A heavy rain and heavy snow warning
has been issued.

01:07:08.483 --> 01:07:10.276
Don't go out if it's not
strictly necessary...

01:07:10.401 --> 01:07:14.322
HEAVY RAIN SPECIAL WARNING

01:07:14.322 --> 01:07:15.323
You kids.

01:07:16.074 --> 01:07:18.493
It's dangerous to walk around
unsupervised.

01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:20.620
Are you all siblings?

01:07:20.745 --> 01:07:21.746
Er...

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:23.665
We're going home.

01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:26.709
I'm a college student.
They're my younger brothers.

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:30.588
I see.
Can you show me your ID?

01:07:30.713 --> 01:07:32.840
I don't have it on me.

01:07:33.174 --> 01:07:34.759
Maybe it's him.

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:37.887
He may be carrying a gun.
Be careful.

01:07:38.763 --> 01:07:42.850
And you? Are you in high school?
That's a big backpack.

01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:45.478
Can you remove your hood?

01:07:46.854 --> 01:07:47.981
Hina.

01:07:48.189 --> 01:07:49.107
Run away.

01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:52.110
Hey! Wait!

01:07:53.027 --> 01:07:54.112
Stop!

01:07:56.114 --> 01:07:58.116
- Gotcha!
- Let me go!

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.118
Resisting arrest.

01:08:04.664 --> 01:08:06.291
- Let me go!
- Stop struggling.

01:08:07.792 --> 01:08:08.543
Hodaka!

01:08:10.295 --> 01:08:11.379
Stop!

01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:15.425
Hina.

01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:17.093
Please!

01:08:33.026 --> 01:08:33.860
It's dangerous.

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:41.075
Let's go, Hina.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:42.869
- Jeez.
- Let's go take a look.

01:08:44.037 --> 01:08:45.079
Sempai.

01:08:54.172 --> 01:08:55.882
It's $280 a night.

01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:59.260
$280. Can you pay?

01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:00.887
Huh? Yes. I'll pay.

01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:14.859
Seems like I'm a wanted man now.

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:16.652
That's so cool.

01:09:20.698 --> 01:09:23.993
- I was really worried.
- You almost got arrested.

01:09:24.118 --> 01:09:28.164
I totally panicked.
There's nothing to laugh about.

01:09:28.456 --> 01:09:29.415
This room is huge!

01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:31.918
The bed's huge!
The bathroom's huge!

01:09:35.296 --> 01:09:36.923
Hina. Hodaka.

01:09:37.048 --> 01:09:38.716
Let's take a bath together.

01:09:39.217 --> 01:09:40.843
Do it alone.

01:09:41.594 --> 01:09:44.806
Hodaka, let's take
a boys-only bath together.

01:09:47.683 --> 01:09:49.936
It's so warm.

01:09:50.061 --> 01:09:51.437
What's this?

01:09:54.399 --> 01:09:56.609
- Wow!
- Amazing.

01:09:57.443 --> 01:09:58.694
Switch.

01:09:59.821 --> 01:10:01.697
There's a lot of stuff.

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:04.575
- What do you want?
- Let's try them all, Sempai.

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:06.911
- Are you sure?
- I got severance pay.

01:10:07.036 --> 01:10:10.289
Hina, we're having
a gorgeous dinner tonight.

01:10:10.498 --> 01:10:11.916
Looking forward to it.

01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:14.961
FRIED CHICKEN

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:16.462
Here I am.

01:10:18.172 --> 01:10:19.882
Welcome back.

01:10:30.393 --> 01:10:31.477
Let's eat.

01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:34.355
Let me try that, Hodaka.

01:10:35.356 --> 01:10:37.817
- The curry's yummy.
- Yakisoba's delicious.

01:10:37.942 --> 01:10:39.402
I want some too.

01:10:39.610 --> 01:10:41.571
Isn't it too early, Hodaka?

01:10:41.696 --> 01:10:43.489
Tastes yummier if you wait
only two minutes.

01:10:43.781 --> 01:10:46.284
The fortune cookie in love

01:10:46.409 --> 01:10:49.704
The future's not looking so grim

01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:52.248
The thing that's in your heart

01:10:52.832 --> 01:10:55.126
The thing that soon will disappear

01:10:55.251 --> 01:11:00.006
Dear God, if you really exist,
I beg you.

01:11:00.548 --> 01:11:04.218
This is more than enough.
We don't need anything else.

01:11:04.552 --> 01:11:06.762
We'll manage somehow.

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:11.809
So please, don't give us
anything more,

01:11:12.518 --> 01:11:15.146
and don't take anything
more from us.

01:11:16.564 --> 01:11:19.942
I beg you please, Dear God.

01:11:20.443 --> 01:11:23.696
Let us be together
like this forever.

01:11:26.824 --> 01:11:27.909
Hina.

01:11:28.743 --> 01:11:31.287
Happy 18th birthday.

01:11:32.497 --> 01:11:36.292
It's cheap, but I've picked something
that'd look good on you.

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:40.796
Thanks.

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:45.801
Tell me, Hodaka.

01:11:46.344 --> 01:11:50.890
Would you like
this rain to stop?

01:11:52.808 --> 01:11:53.559
Yes.

01:12:01.734 --> 01:12:04.487
I was chosen to be
a human sacrifice.

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:09.575
Natsumi told me about
the sunshine girl's fate.

01:12:10.284 --> 01:12:16.207
She gets sacrificed and disappears,
then the weather goes back to normal.

01:12:17.416 --> 01:12:18.334
Come on.

01:12:18.543 --> 01:12:23.798
They're always telling weird stories.
It's not like people disappear...

01:12:36.561 --> 01:12:37.728
What are you looking at?

01:12:38.145 --> 01:12:39.647
I'm not looking...

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:47.405
I'm looking at you.

01:12:48.739 --> 01:12:51.158
Why are you crying?

01:12:54.078 --> 01:12:58.124
The more I pray for sunshine, the more
my body becomes transparent.

01:12:58.916 --> 01:13:01.002
I'm sure that,
if I die this way,

01:13:01.794 --> 01:13:05.006
the usual summer
will come back.

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:07.508
- Take care of Nagi.
- No.

01:13:08.259 --> 01:13:11.137
No way.
You're not going anywhere.

01:13:11.262 --> 01:13:13.014
We'll live together.
The three of us.

01:13:13.139 --> 01:13:14.140
Hodaka.

01:13:14.265 --> 01:13:16.767
Let's make a promise, Hina.

01:13:17.685 --> 01:13:18.853
We'll always be together.

01:13:21.814 --> 01:13:24.483
I'll work.
I'll earn enough for all of us.

01:13:24.609 --> 01:13:28.279
You quit the sunshine girl job.
Your body will go back to normal.

01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:29.488
So...

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:50.801
I had a dream.

01:13:51.052 --> 01:13:52.887
I was still on the island.

01:14:01.354 --> 01:14:02.897
I wanted to leave.

01:14:03.022 --> 01:14:07.109
I was rushing desperately,
trying to reach the light.

01:14:09.111 --> 01:14:13.824
When I thought I did,
I reached a dead end instead.

01:14:14.742 --> 01:14:19.038
Then I decided I wanted
to enter that light.

01:14:20.873 --> 01:14:24.543
And at the edge of it,
I found you.

01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:28.631
I had a dream.

01:14:29.507 --> 01:14:31.634
The day I met you.

01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:36.931
You looked like a lost kitten.

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:42.436
But you've found a meaning
for my existence.

01:14:43.062 --> 01:14:48.109
I kept working as the sunshine girl
'cos I was happy to make people smile.

01:14:48.943 --> 01:14:50.903
I'm really glad I've met you.

01:14:53.948 --> 01:14:56.951
So, don't cry, Hodaka.

01:15:12.633 --> 01:15:14.093
What is this place?

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:18.639
Hodaka...

01:16:06.771 --> 01:16:08.105
Hina?

01:16:08.522 --> 01:16:09.607
Where are you?

01:16:10.024 --> 01:16:10.858
Hina.

01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:13.861
- Hina?
- What's wrong, Hodaka?

01:16:14.278 --> 01:16:16.822
Hina's disappeared.

01:16:18.282 --> 01:16:23.120
I just dreamt...
that she was disappearing in the sky.

01:16:28.876 --> 01:16:30.169
Don't tell me...

01:16:31.796 --> 01:16:32.630
Open the door.

01:16:33.714 --> 01:16:35.883
- Open up!
- What?

01:16:38.636 --> 01:16:40.387
Hodaka Morishima, right?

01:16:40.888 --> 01:16:47.019
You're a missing person. And suspected
of unlawful possession of a weapon.

01:16:47.144 --> 01:16:49.396
- Come to the police station.
- Let me go!

01:16:49.522 --> 01:16:51.398
- I won't hurt you.
- Let me go, I said!

01:16:51.524 --> 01:16:53.400
- Hodaka!
- Sempai.

01:16:53.734 --> 01:16:55.653
Don't struggle.

01:17:09.083 --> 01:17:10.668
Keep going.

01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:19.468
After months of rain, the Kanto plain is
finally seeing some brilliant sunshine.

01:17:19.593 --> 01:17:22.471
It seems unreal.

01:17:23.055 --> 01:17:24.932
In the last few hours,
a sudden change in...

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:27.393
By 8 a.m. the temperature
was already over 77°F.

01:17:27.518 --> 01:17:28.936
IT'S A MIRACLE!
Many areas around the
Arakawa river are flooded.

01:17:28.936 --> 01:17:30.855
Many areas around the
Arakawa river are flooded.

01:17:30.855 --> 01:17:32.064
THANKS SUNSHINE GIRL
I SAW HER IN A DREAM

01:17:32.064 --> 01:17:32.773
The transport system
is still paralyzed...

01:17:32.773 --> 01:17:33.691
I THINK I HAD
THE SAME DREAM

01:17:33.691 --> 01:17:35.401
The extent of the damage
has yet to be assessed.

01:17:35.526 --> 01:17:38.445
It'll take a few days
at least for recovery.

01:17:38.612 --> 01:17:42.157
Everyone looks happy
under the clear blue sky.

01:17:42.283 --> 01:17:44.159
- Hey, look at the sky.
- Is it for real?

01:17:44.285 --> 01:17:46.203
- It's sunny.
- It cleared up!

01:17:46.453 --> 01:17:48.205
The sky's so clear.

01:17:48.539 --> 01:17:50.165
I feel like crying.

01:17:50.291 --> 01:17:53.502
Finally, real summer
has arrived.

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:04.972
What are you doing?

01:18:08.559 --> 01:18:09.727
Hina...

01:18:10.811 --> 01:18:12.479
...sacrificed herself.

01:18:13.230 --> 01:18:15.316
- Hina! Tell me it's not true!
- Hey!

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:17.067
Hina!

01:18:21.447 --> 01:18:24.074
I've got a question.

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:30.289
The girl who was with you yesterday
is 15-year-old Hina Amano, right?

01:18:31.332 --> 01:18:33.250
Do you know where she is?

01:18:34.293 --> 01:18:37.087
Hina's 15?

01:18:37.588 --> 01:18:39.340
Not 18?

01:18:39.673 --> 01:18:43.177
She faked her resume
at work.

01:18:43.302 --> 01:18:46.847
I guess she had to make a living,
but she's still in middle school.

01:18:47.264 --> 01:18:49.642
Compulsory school age.

01:18:49.975 --> 01:18:51.393
Didn't you know?

01:18:52.645 --> 01:18:54.146
What the heck?

01:18:54.813 --> 01:18:58.233
I'm the oldest one.

01:18:58.651 --> 01:19:00.194
What a pain.

01:19:01.153 --> 01:19:04.490
Don't you know
where she may be?

01:19:05.324 --> 01:19:10.412
The sky has cleared because
she offered herself in exchange.

01:19:10.955 --> 01:19:14.875
And nobody knows that...
I can't take it.

01:19:15.334 --> 01:19:16.961
This is a pain.

01:19:17.086 --> 01:19:18.879
Will we need an expert
medical witness?

01:19:23.384 --> 01:19:24.885
It's clear.

01:19:38.732 --> 01:19:41.026
Daddy!
Did you look outside?

01:19:41.151 --> 01:19:42.319
Yeah, I did.

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:44.780
I dreamt of Hina.

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:48.909
I'm sure it was her
who brought the sunshine again.

01:19:52.162 --> 01:19:53.163
Yeah.

01:19:54.164 --> 01:19:56.125
Maybe you're right.

01:19:57.751 --> 01:20:00.170
IKEBUKURO POLICE STATION

01:20:00.671 --> 01:20:03.632
Detective,
I've got a favor to ask you.

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:05.634
What?

01:20:05.759 --> 01:20:10.639
Let me go look for Hina.
It's my turn to help her now.

01:20:10.764 --> 01:20:12.641
I'll come back
as soon as I find her.

01:20:12.766 --> 01:20:16.562
I'll listen to you in here.
Come on.

01:20:18.397 --> 01:20:21.066
Tell Mr. Yasui
we'll interrogate him now.

01:20:21.191 --> 01:20:21.942
Yes, Sir.

01:20:23.569 --> 01:20:25.195
Hey! Wait!

01:20:28.073 --> 01:20:29.491
Wait!

01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:32.119
Someone stop him!

01:20:32.411 --> 01:20:33.537
Stop!

01:20:36.457 --> 01:20:38.709
- That brat!
- Don't let him get out of here.

01:20:39.793 --> 01:20:40.711
Stop!

01:20:41.628 --> 01:20:42.755
Wait!

01:20:42.963 --> 01:20:43.714
Stop!

01:20:49.094 --> 01:20:50.304
Bastard.

01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:54.058
What the hell?!

01:20:55.517 --> 01:20:56.810
Cheeky bastard.

01:20:56.935 --> 01:20:57.936
Cross the street.

01:21:05.694 --> 01:21:06.820
Darn!

01:21:15.245 --> 01:21:16.080
Hodaka.

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:22.294
- Natsumi?
- What are you doing?

01:21:22.461 --> 01:21:23.837
I'm going to find Hina.

01:21:27.299 --> 01:21:28.425
Get on.

01:21:34.431 --> 01:21:35.849
That brat!

01:21:37.017 --> 01:21:38.852
Nagi called.

01:21:39.144 --> 01:21:42.106
He said Hina has disappeared
and you got arrested.

01:21:42.231 --> 01:21:43.315
Where is he?

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:45.859
At the Child Consultation Center.

01:21:50.405 --> 01:21:54.618
How exciting.
We're outlaws now!

01:21:55.369 --> 01:21:57.996
Where are we going, then?

01:22:02.459 --> 01:22:04.586
What? Another visitor?

01:22:04.711 --> 01:22:07.381
VISITOR: AYANE HANAZAWA

01:22:07.464 --> 01:22:08.841
Oh, another girl.

01:22:08.966 --> 01:22:11.718
He's popular.

01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:14.263
VISITING ROOM

01:22:14.638 --> 01:22:16.807
Ayane! You're here too.

01:22:17.266 --> 01:22:19.434
- Kana, this is Ayane.
- Pleased to meet you.

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.645
- Ayane, this is Kana.
- Nice to meet you.

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:25.732
And she's officer Sasaki.
She'll be here with me all day.

01:22:25.858 --> 01:22:29.736
You're like a VIP, Nagi.
Pleased to meet you.

01:22:29.862 --> 01:22:32.990
TODAY'S MEETING RECORD

01:22:33.115 --> 01:22:35.033
Sorry for the sudden news.

01:22:35.159 --> 01:22:39.079
Really! When I heard they took you
into custody, my heart almost stopped.

01:22:39.204 --> 01:22:41.456
Same for me.
My heart's still pounding.

01:22:41.582 --> 01:22:43.542
Touch and feel it, Nagi.

01:22:45.502 --> 01:22:46.920
Oh, you're right.

01:22:51.175 --> 01:22:53.260
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

01:22:53.385 --> 01:22:56.889
It's my first visit.
I'm a bit nervous.

01:22:57.014 --> 01:22:58.098
Huh?

01:22:58.307 --> 01:23:00.142
I need the toilet.

01:23:00.267 --> 01:23:01.894
Oh, OK.

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:06.398
Thanks, I owe you one.

01:23:06.523 --> 01:23:11.612
Jeez. You even call your ex
when you need something.

01:23:12.154 --> 01:23:12.905
Here.

01:23:13.322 --> 01:23:15.908
Look the other way.
I'll take my clothes off.

01:23:26.376 --> 01:23:28.128
Mr. Keisuke Suga.

01:23:28.253 --> 01:23:29.630
Thanks for yesterday.

01:23:29.755 --> 01:23:31.298
You again?

01:23:31.423 --> 01:23:34.676
Summer's finally back
the way it should, huh?

01:23:35.802 --> 01:23:38.847
I told you I know nothing
about that runaway boy.

01:23:38.972 --> 01:23:40.891
Can we check out
your office for a minute?

01:23:41.016 --> 01:23:43.936
- Hey, what's that for?
- Oh, it's flooded.

01:23:44.394 --> 01:23:45.938
There's no one in there.

01:23:47.648 --> 01:23:51.193
Well, it's a bit
embarrassing, but...

01:23:51.568 --> 01:23:53.445
Huh? He ran away?

01:23:53.779 --> 01:23:54.988
From the police station?

01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:57.449
A derelict building in Yoyogi?

01:23:57.824 --> 01:23:59.660
That's where she became
a sunshine girl.

01:23:59.785 --> 01:24:00.911
Bend down!

01:24:02.454 --> 01:24:07.459
She said she got connected to the sky
on the roof of that building.

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:10.295
So, if I go there, I'm sure...

01:24:15.217 --> 01:24:16.301
Oh, no!

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:21.890
You, on that bike!
Stop!

01:24:22.641 --> 01:24:24.142
Hold tight!

01:24:31.483 --> 01:24:32.609
Whoa!

01:24:33.485 --> 01:24:34.403
Natsumi!

01:24:34.528 --> 01:24:37.739
Am I awesome or what?
I think I was born for this.

01:24:38.448 --> 01:24:39.491
Maybe...

01:24:39.783 --> 01:24:43.120
...I should become a speed cop!

01:24:43.328 --> 01:24:46.498
They won't hire you now.

01:24:49.459 --> 01:24:52.838
As for the reason for his escape...

01:24:53.338 --> 01:24:57.592
I think he may be searching
for the girl who was with him.

01:24:57.843 --> 01:25:01.013
I'M GOING SHOPPING
ASUKA

01:25:01.555 --> 01:25:06.268
He said she's disappeared
in exchange for this good weather.

01:25:07.602 --> 01:25:09.855
What? Don't tell me you...

01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:12.274
No, I don't believe it.

01:25:12.607 --> 01:25:16.320
But, he's throwing his life away.

01:25:17.988 --> 01:25:22.617
And all because there's a girl
he wants to meet so badly.

01:25:22.743 --> 01:25:25.912
MOKA 2 Y/O
MOKA 1 Y/O
Makes me feel a bit envious.

01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:30.083
There's not much point
in telling me that.

01:25:34.004 --> 01:25:36.214
Mr. Suga, you...

01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:37.341
Huh?

01:25:38.842 --> 01:25:40.218
Are you OK?

01:25:40.385 --> 01:25:41.428
Why?

01:25:42.095 --> 01:25:44.931
Well, you are...

01:25:45.307 --> 01:25:46.767
...crying.

01:25:55.817 --> 01:25:56.693
Oh, no.

01:25:59.363 --> 01:26:00.447
We're jumping in!

01:26:12.292 --> 01:26:13.502
Can't go any further.

01:26:13.627 --> 01:26:15.420
Go, Hodaka.

01:26:19.257 --> 01:26:21.218
Thank you, Natsumi.

01:26:26.223 --> 01:26:27.474
Hodaka!

01:26:28.475 --> 01:26:30.394
Run!

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:59.965
Hina. Hina. Hina. Hina!

01:27:00.549 --> 01:27:04.302
Are you there? Hina!

01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:07.722
Hey, Hodaka.

01:27:08.432 --> 01:27:09.975
It'll clear up now.

01:27:12.561 --> 01:27:13.895
It's for you.

01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:16.231
You've eaten that for dinner
three nights in a row.

01:27:16.356 --> 01:27:18.567
- Does it hurt?
- You're a runaway, aren't you?

01:27:18.692 --> 01:27:21.069
But, you can't enjoy Tokyo
with this rain.

01:27:21.403 --> 01:27:22.571
Younger than me.

01:27:22.696 --> 01:27:24.322
I'll be 18 next month.

01:27:24.448 --> 01:27:25.699
You should treat me
with respect.

01:27:25.824 --> 01:27:27.284
Are you hungry, Hodaka?

01:27:27.409 --> 01:27:28.577
Sit there and relax.

01:27:28.743 --> 01:27:30.078
How do you like
living in Tokyo?

01:27:30.412 --> 01:27:32.080
Come to think of it,

01:27:32.289 --> 01:27:35.125
I don't feel like
I'm suffocating anymore.

01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:36.835
Happy to hear that.

01:27:37.043 --> 01:27:41.590
I'm in love with
this sunshine girl job.

01:27:42.466 --> 01:27:45.343
Thank you, Hodaka.

01:27:48.388 --> 01:27:50.348
Someone got onto the tracks.

01:27:50.599 --> 01:27:52.350
- Who's that?
- Hey, you!

01:27:52.601 --> 01:27:54.102
It's dangerous!

01:27:54.311 --> 01:27:55.729
Hey! What are you doing?

01:27:55.854 --> 01:27:57.814
It's dangerous! Stop!

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:03.236
- What's that? Hilarious.
- What is he doing?

01:28:03.361 --> 01:28:05.614
- There's someone running.
- He'll get arrested.

01:28:05.739 --> 01:28:07.532
There are idiots like that.

01:28:22.506 --> 01:28:24.508
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:28:24.633 --> 01:28:26.176
I'm sorry, Hina!

01:28:26.301 --> 01:28:28.220
I made you do that
sunshine girl thing.

01:28:28.345 --> 01:28:31.640
You've shouldered
all responsibility.

01:28:31.765 --> 01:28:32.557
Tell me...

01:28:33.058 --> 01:28:34.059
...Hodaka.

01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:37.854
Would you like
this rain to stop?

01:29:06.049 --> 01:29:07.092
Mr. Suga?

01:29:08.009 --> 01:29:10.345
I was looking for you,
Hodaka.

01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:11.263
Why?

01:29:11.388 --> 01:29:14.558
Do you realize
what you're doing?

01:29:14.683 --> 01:29:16.226
Hina's disappeared.

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:19.604
It's my fault.
The sunshine girl job was my idea.

01:29:19.729 --> 01:29:20.605
Hodaka, you...

01:29:20.730 --> 01:29:22.691
It's my turn to help her now!

01:29:25.068 --> 01:29:26.194
I must go.

01:29:27.404 --> 01:29:28.196
Wait!

01:29:28.363 --> 01:29:29.197
Where are you...

01:29:29.322 --> 01:29:31.449
I can go to heaven
through there!

01:29:34.286 --> 01:29:35.579
What are you saying?

01:29:35.704 --> 01:29:38.665
She's in the sky!
I'll use the emergency stairs.

01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:42.294
- She can't be up there...
- I have to help her!

01:29:42.419 --> 01:29:44.212
Get a grip!

01:29:45.714 --> 01:29:47.757
Calm down.

01:29:47.882 --> 01:29:49.801
Go back to the police station.

01:29:49.926 --> 01:29:52.971
They'll understand.
You've done nothing wrong.

01:29:53.555 --> 01:29:57.976
If you keep running away,
it" be too late. You know that.

01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:00.979
Suspect's car found.
Going to apprehend him.

01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:04.232
Don't worry,
I'll come with you.

01:30:04.733 --> 01:30:06.985
Let's explain everything
together, OK?

01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:08.445
Let me go! Please!

01:30:08.570 --> 01:30:10.447
Calm down.

01:30:10.572 --> 01:30:11.489
Get off me!

01:30:12.115 --> 01:30:13.742
You bastard!

01:30:18.330 --> 01:30:19.998
Don't stand in my way!

01:30:21.583 --> 01:30:23.710
Hodaka. That's...

01:30:23.835 --> 01:30:27.088
Let me go see Hina.

01:30:36.222 --> 01:30:42.437
I was born with nothing
in my hand

01:30:43.063 --> 01:30:48.777
Forever wallowing
in an eternal gap

01:30:48.902 --> 01:30:50.362
Hodaka Morishima.

01:30:50.695 --> 01:30:51.988
Drop the gun.

01:30:52.322 --> 01:30:55.617
Hey, wait a minute.

01:30:56.076 --> 01:30:59.079
It's a misunderstanding.
I'll explain.

01:30:59.204 --> 01:31:00.330
Right, Hodaka?

01:31:02.457 --> 01:31:03.875
You...

01:31:04.167 --> 01:31:06.378
Put the gun down,
Morishima.

01:31:06.503 --> 01:31:08.380
Please don't make me shoot.

01:31:20.892 --> 01:31:21.893
Hodaka.

01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:24.604
Come on Hodaka,
just put it down.

01:31:24.771 --> 01:31:28.358
What's wrong with you guys?
He's just a kid!

01:31:28.483 --> 01:31:29.901
Leave me alone!

01:31:30.151 --> 01:31:35.073
Why are you holding me up? You all
know nothing. You pretend you don't.

01:31:35.281 --> 01:31:38.576
I just want to see her...

01:31:38.993 --> 01:31:39.911
...once more!

01:31:46.543 --> 01:31:47.335
Got him!

01:31:50.130 --> 01:31:51.589
Let go of me!

01:31:52.173 --> 01:31:55.593
Take your hands off
Hodaka, assholes!

01:31:58.096 --> 01:31:59.180
You bastard!

01:32:00.473 --> 01:32:02.809
Go, Hodaka!

01:32:04.936 --> 01:32:05.687
Stop!

01:32:07.147 --> 01:32:07.939
Hodaka.

01:32:09.691 --> 01:32:10.692
Nagi!

01:32:12.110 --> 01:32:13.027
Hey!

01:32:13.153 --> 01:32:15.613
It's all your fault, Hodaka.

01:32:16.948 --> 01:32:18.616
Bring my sister back!

01:32:24.122 --> 01:32:30.462
Is there still anything
that love can do?

01:32:30.879 --> 01:32:38.553
Is there still anything
that I can do?

01:32:40.221 --> 01:32:45.935
You gave me strength,

01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:52.525
now I must use it for you

01:32:52.901 --> 01:33:00.325
Is there still anything
that love can do?

01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:33.274
Sky fish?

01:33:59.133 --> 01:34:02.178
Hina!

01:34:18.486 --> 01:34:20.196
Hina!

01:34:21.739 --> 01:34:23.575
Hina!

01:34:35.003 --> 01:34:36.421
Hina!

01:34:37.422 --> 01:34:42.427
We gave up on our wings to fly

01:34:42.844 --> 01:34:44.429
- Hina!
- Hodaka!

01:34:44.429 --> 01:34:49.475
And chose to hold
each other's hands

01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:56.024
But the sky above
kept us transfixed

01:34:57.233 --> 01:35:02.614
Is it a crime to
dream another dream?

01:35:05.491 --> 01:35:11.205
Summer sees the back of autumn

01:35:11.205 --> 01:35:12.957
- Don't let go of my hands.
- OK.

01:35:12.957 --> 01:35:17.420
Guessing what it
looks like from behind

01:35:18.671 --> 01:35:23.968
Is this a yearning,
is this love?

01:35:25.261 --> 01:35:30.767
It's unrequited, we know

01:35:30.892 --> 01:35:31.893
Hina!

01:35:32.101 --> 01:35:33.519
Hodaka!

01:35:35.063 --> 01:35:38.107
Today once in a thousand years

01:35:38.232 --> 01:35:40.109
Gravity falls asleep

01:35:40.276 --> 01:35:42.320
Let's go home, Hina.

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:44.238
Let's stand on the
blind side of the sun

01:35:44.238 --> 01:35:46.032
But, if I do,
the weather will...

01:35:46.032 --> 01:35:47.075
To leave this planet now

01:35:48.034 --> 01:35:49.077
When he's awake
It's enough.

01:35:49.077 --> 01:35:50.328
When he's awake

01:35:50.328 --> 01:35:51.579
You don't have to be
the sunshine girl anymore.

01:35:51.579 --> 01:35:53.790
We'll be where they
can't bring us back

01:35:54.707 --> 01:35:57.126
Jump out on the count of three

01:35:57.293 --> 01:36:00.254
To some place else

01:36:03.383 --> 01:36:04.342
We go

01:36:05.343 --> 01:36:07.887
Who cares if we don't
see the sunshine again.

01:36:08.179 --> 01:36:11.057
I want you
more than any blue sky.

01:36:12.892 --> 01:36:14.352
The weather...

01:36:14.602 --> 01:36:16.521
...can stay crazy!

01:36:17.438 --> 01:36:20.566
Let's raise the
sail of our dream

01:36:20.733 --> 01:36:23.945
For the day to come
when the night is through

01:36:24.112 --> 01:36:27.156
Here we are with
hearts full of hope

01:36:27.323 --> 01:36:29.450
That the rest would
take care of itself

01:36:29.575 --> 01:36:31.035
Put my arm around you

01:36:31.244 --> 01:36:34.205
It's not that we're not scared

01:36:34.330 --> 01:36:36.207
But we won't stop

01:36:36.374 --> 01:36:39.252
We may get ahead of hard times

01:36:39.419 --> 01:36:42.797
But what good does it do?

01:36:42.964 --> 01:36:48.845
Our love tells us,
a voice tells us

01:36:49.303 --> 01:36:51.305
To go

01:36:56.144 --> 01:36:58.187
Pray for yourself...

01:36:59.272 --> 01:37:00.356
...Hina.

01:37:01.733 --> 01:37:02.692
OK.

01:37:22.628 --> 01:37:23.838
Hodaka.

01:37:42.065 --> 01:37:48.029
All love songs had been sung

01:37:48.821 --> 01:37:55.119
Myriad movies had
told their stories

01:37:55.828 --> 01:38:01.709
You and I were born

01:38:02.502 --> 01:38:07.590
in such a wasteland, and yet

01:38:09.175 --> 01:38:13.596
The rain started falling again
that day, and never stopped.

01:38:13.971 --> 01:38:17.683
It's slowly sinking Tokyo
into the water.

01:38:18.476 --> 01:38:22.605
And it's still falling now,
three years later.

01:38:25.149 --> 01:38:32.990
How fast time flies, I can't believe
how quickly the moments have passed...

01:38:33.157 --> 01:38:43.793
The precious years have come and gone
too seen, here with you

01:38:44.627 --> 01:38:56.848
I've learned from you the right way
to do what must be done

01:38:59.642 --> 01:39:03.229
What can I say?

01:39:03.229 --> 01:39:03.813
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR GRADUATION

01:39:03.938 --> 01:39:07.859
GRADUATION CEREMONY

01:39:10.153 --> 01:39:13.489
Er... You're moving
to Tokyo, aren't you?

01:39:13.614 --> 01:39:15.366
Huh? Yeah.

01:39:16.117 --> 01:39:18.953
Come on, ask him.
It's now or never.

01:39:19.245 --> 01:39:21.747
So, possibly, this is...

01:39:21.956 --> 01:39:26.794
You know... There's something
I've always wanted to ask you.

01:39:26.919 --> 01:39:29.130
...the first time someone
tells me they love me?

01:39:29.714 --> 01:39:32.383
I'd like to know...

01:39:32.758 --> 01:39:33.634
Er...

01:39:34.135 --> 01:39:37.513
Is it true you're wanted
by the police in Tokyo?

01:39:38.514 --> 01:39:39.348
Huh?

01:39:43.603 --> 01:39:46.189
That summer of three years ago,

01:39:47.481 --> 01:39:50.943
I was arrested and went on trial.

01:39:51.068 --> 01:39:54.989
They put me on probation
until graduation.

01:39:55.364 --> 01:39:58.284
The island, my parents' house
and the school...

01:39:58.451 --> 01:40:01.954
They all were the same old places
where I was supposed to live.

01:40:02.121 --> 01:40:06.667
But, I just kept quietly waiting
for graduation.

01:40:07.919 --> 01:40:08.920
I haven't...

01:40:10.504 --> 01:40:13.507
...seen Hina since that day.

01:40:15.551 --> 01:40:18.429
I have no idea what I'll think

01:40:18.888 --> 01:40:23.059
seeing Tokyo after it changed,

01:40:23.601 --> 01:40:26.395
nor what I'll say to her.

01:40:27.730 --> 01:40:29.315
Tomorrow's weather
for the Kanto region.

01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:32.360
COLLEGE ENTRANCE GUIDE

01:40:33.319 --> 01:40:35.529
Now I need to find
a part-time job.

01:40:35.696 --> 01:40:36.989
JOB SEARCH

01:40:38.032 --> 01:40:42.119
HIRING PART-TIME
LOOKING FOR FOOD SERVICE WORKER

01:40:42.536 --> 01:40:48.167
The high will be 59°F. Same or slightly
hotter than today in most areas.

01:40:48.167 --> 01:40:50.586
ANTHROPOCENE - EDUCATION FOR
THE "NEW GEOLOGY GENERATION"

01:40:50.711 --> 01:40:52.171
Speaking of part-time jobs...

01:40:56.717 --> 01:40:57.885
SUNSHINE FOR YOU

01:40:57.885 --> 01:40:59.136
It's still there.

01:41:00.721 --> 01:41:03.391
1 REQUEST

01:41:04.684 --> 01:41:07.144
It was a sunshine girl request

01:41:07.687 --> 01:41:09.522
from two years ago.

01:41:09.647 --> 01:41:13.109
Next stop Takashimadaira.

01:41:13.609 --> 01:41:15.611
Look who's here.
Are you alone?

01:41:15.736 --> 01:41:17.655
TACHIBANA
Where's the sunshine girl?

01:41:18.239 --> 01:41:21.158
She's no longer
a sunshine girl.

01:41:21.409 --> 01:41:24.412
I came just to tell you that.

01:41:25.413 --> 01:41:26.914
Don't trouble yourself.

01:41:28.124 --> 01:41:32.628
You moved. You used to live
in an older house downtown.

01:41:32.753 --> 01:41:36.382
The whole area
is under water now.

01:41:36.632 --> 01:41:37.675
I'm sorry.

01:41:38.467 --> 01:41:39.927
Why do you apologize?

01:41:40.428 --> 01:41:41.345
Urn...

01:41:44.682 --> 01:41:50.021
You know, that area
used to be under the sea.

01:41:50.146 --> 01:41:54.108
Until 200 years ago.

01:41:55.192 --> 01:41:58.738
In old times, Tokyo
was just a bay.

01:41:58.946 --> 01:42:03.242
Human beings and the weather
changed it, little by little.

01:42:04.410 --> 01:42:10.291
So, well... I think it's just
gone back to its original self.

01:42:11.792 --> 01:42:12.960
What the heck...?

01:42:13.336 --> 01:42:15.463
You've been thinking
about that crap for three years?

01:42:15.671 --> 01:42:16.881
Don't say that...

01:42:17.006 --> 01:42:20.885
You're about to start college,
but you're still acting like a kid.

01:42:21.010 --> 01:42:23.012
But, that day we...

01:42:23.137 --> 01:42:28.225
You two caused this?
You changed the world?

01:42:30.311 --> 01:42:34.774
Bullshit.
Don't flatter yourself, dummy.

01:42:36.609 --> 01:42:39.236
Look, I went on a date
with my daughter.

01:42:39.695 --> 01:42:41.989
But, Natsumi and Nagi
were in the way.

01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:47.244
Stop brooding over
stupid stuff and go see her.

01:42:47.370 --> 01:42:48.788
Why haven't you?

01:42:48.913 --> 01:42:52.500
I was on probation.
I didn't want to cause her trouble.

01:42:52.625 --> 01:42:54.627
She doesn't even have a cellphone.

01:42:54.752 --> 01:42:56.962
And I'm so nervous.

01:42:57.088 --> 01:42:59.715
I don't know what to say to her.

01:43:04.637 --> 01:43:08.224
Rain?
You're so big now.

01:43:08.557 --> 01:43:11.977
Come on, get out of here.
Go now. I've got work to do!

01:43:12.103 --> 01:43:14.021
Just go to her house.

01:43:14.855 --> 01:43:16.273
Thank you for your time.

01:43:16.399 --> 01:43:17.691
Come back again.

01:43:18.192 --> 01:43:19.443
Hey.

01:43:20.528 --> 01:43:23.572
Don't sweat it, young man.

01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:28.619
The world's always
been crazy anyway.

01:43:38.212 --> 01:43:41.882
Next stop Hamamatsucho.

01:43:42.633 --> 01:43:44.677
- You're super positive.
- You think?

01:43:44.802 --> 01:43:46.887
- Looking forward to the picnic.
- Yeah!

01:43:57.773 --> 01:44:00.568
It was under the sea.

01:44:02.445 --> 01:44:06.031
The world's always been crazy.

01:44:08.701 --> 01:44:12.997
So, it's no one's fault
that it's like this.

01:44:13.247 --> 01:44:16.917
Is this what I should
say to her?

01:44:28.012 --> 01:44:31.640
I was about to cry

01:44:31.807 --> 01:44:35.352
cause I can see

01:44:35.519 --> 01:44:39.064
How you carry the world

01:44:39.231 --> 01:44:43.444
on your tiny shoulders

01:44:48.324 --> 01:44:50.784
No. That's not it.

01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:55.623
That day, I...
We changed the world.

01:44:56.332 --> 01:44:57.791
I made a choice.

01:44:57.917 --> 01:45:01.545
I've chosen her. I've chosen this world.
I've chosen to live here.

01:45:02.213 --> 01:45:02.963
Hina!

01:45:09.094 --> 01:45:09.970
Hodaka!

01:45:17.728 --> 01:45:20.981
What's wrong?
Are you OK?

01:45:23.442 --> 01:45:24.443
Yeah.

01:45:24.818 --> 01:45:27.571
Hina, I'm sure...

01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:29.657
...we're gonna be OK.

01:45:29.823 --> 01:45:33.536
I was about to cry

01:45:33.661 --> 01:45:37.289
cause I can see

01:45:37.414 --> 01:45:41.043
How you carry the world

01:45:41.168 --> 01:45:45.214

I was born with
nothing in my hand

01:47:48.253 --> 01:47:54.259
Forever wallowing
in an eternal gap

01:47:54.843 --> 01:48:01.225

Rulers and Gods
pretend they don't see

But I know deep down
that they all see

01:48:35.426 --> 01:48:41.640
Bravery, hope and ties that bind

Even when the whole world
turns its back on us

You defy it, you're still here

01:49:15.799 --> 01:49:22.389
Is there still anything
that love can do?

01:49:22.556 --> 01:49:30.481
Is there still anything
that I can do?

01:49:35.235 --> 01:49:41.241
You gave me strength

01:49:42.034 --> 01:49:47.790

Yet we cling on, how ugly we are
