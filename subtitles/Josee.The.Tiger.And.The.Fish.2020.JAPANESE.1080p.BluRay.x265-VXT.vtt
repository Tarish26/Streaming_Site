00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:22.414
-Enjoy.
-If it's this season…

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:25.042
That goes outside.

00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:26.168
Got it.

00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:29.338
Thank you.

00:01:30.965 --> 00:01:31.799
Morning.

00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:34.593
It's also good for storing genomes.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.932
SPANISH GRAMMAR

00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:53.570
MOVING CENTER

00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:56.032
Thanks for your help.

00:02:36.864 --> 00:02:40.284
How was the dive yesterday, Tsuneo?

00:02:41.202 --> 00:02:43.079
I saw a Priolepis nocturna.

00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:45.164
That's awesome!

00:02:45.247 --> 00:02:48.250
I was lucky the sea was so calm.

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:52.546
You're on summer break from college?

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.965
That's right.

00:02:54.548 --> 00:02:57.885
How about doing a dive next Wednesday?

00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:58.803
Sure!

00:02:59.887 --> 00:03:01.806
Bring some girls too.

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:02.974
Sorry?

00:03:03.557 --> 00:03:06.936
At this rate, fish will be our only love.

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.814
But I long for a human one. Right, Tsuneo?

00:03:10.397 --> 00:03:11.733
No time for that.

00:03:12.441 --> 00:03:15.069
I start another part-time job next week.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.073
You're wasting your youth.

00:03:19.156 --> 00:03:21.868
The summer of 22 comes only once.

00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:23.702
Whatever.

00:03:23.786 --> 00:03:25.246
Tsuneo!

00:03:26.914 --> 00:03:28.415
Thank you.

00:03:31.668 --> 00:03:35.422
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

00:03:39.093 --> 00:03:40.845
Is this the right way?

00:03:41.512 --> 00:03:43.765
Help!

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:09.206
That hurts.

00:04:11.793 --> 00:04:14.086
Are you okay?

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:23.679
Kumiko!

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:26.933
Kumiko, are you all right?

00:04:33.397 --> 00:04:36.692
Did you save her, young man? Thank you.

00:04:36.775 --> 00:04:37.609
No.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.362
Are you injured?

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:42.031
I think I'm fine.

00:04:42.698 --> 00:04:46.577
I turn away for one second,
and someone pushes her.

00:04:47.286 --> 00:04:49.621
I almost had a heart attack.

00:04:50.372 --> 00:04:52.959
That hurts! Why did you do that?

00:04:53.042 --> 00:04:54.085
Pervert.

00:04:54.168 --> 00:04:55.002
What?

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:58.172
Stop groping me, you pervert!

00:05:05.304 --> 00:05:07.849
The pervert is following us, Grandma.

00:05:09.391 --> 00:05:10.852
My house is this way.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:14.813
Shall I push?

00:05:14.897 --> 00:05:15.731
No.

00:05:20.903 --> 00:05:22.113
Born this way.

00:05:25.616 --> 00:05:27.743
What about our walk, Grandma?

00:05:27.826 --> 00:05:31.873
We're giving up walks for a while.

00:05:31.956 --> 00:05:33.082
I don't want to.

00:05:33.165 --> 00:05:37.169
Tough. You can't have everything your way.

00:05:40.381 --> 00:05:43.092
Do you always take walks at this hour?

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:48.680
I thought it'd be safer
and we wouldn't be seen.

00:05:49.556 --> 00:05:52.894
But the world is full of scary beasts.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:55.646
Here we are.

00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:09.118
I'll be going.

00:06:09.618 --> 00:06:10.661
Come on in.

00:06:11.954 --> 00:06:14.165
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

00:06:19.962 --> 00:06:20.837
Oh, drat.

00:06:21.422 --> 00:06:23.799
Would octopus dumplings do?

00:06:23.882 --> 00:06:25.759
We're out of rice.

00:06:26.427 --> 00:06:27.261
That's fine.

00:06:38.272 --> 00:06:39.648
Not you again.

00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:42.318
I keep putting him out but he returns.

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:46.447
Don't touch it, Kumiko. It may have fleas.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:47.364
Scat!

00:06:48.991 --> 00:06:51.077
Just here for some free food.

00:06:51.618 --> 00:06:53.829
Do you feed him often?

00:06:54.413 --> 00:06:55.372
I meant you.

00:06:58.667 --> 00:07:01.753
No, he's not a friend. Just a pervert.

00:07:02.754 --> 00:07:04.215
He understands you.

00:07:04.298 --> 00:07:06.675
Of course not. Are you stupid?

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.223
"You're intruding on my territory."

00:07:12.306 --> 00:07:13.390
That's what he said.

00:07:15.142 --> 00:07:16.018
Ms. Kumiko…

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:17.269
Josee.

00:07:17.353 --> 00:07:18.437
What?

00:07:19.021 --> 00:07:21.315
I'm not Kumiko. I'm Josee.

00:07:21.898 --> 00:07:22.733
Josee?

00:07:32.576 --> 00:07:33.410
With thanks.

00:07:40.834 --> 00:07:42.169
Have seconds.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:48.342
Thank you. I can't afford
to buy another box lunch.

00:07:48.425 --> 00:07:51.387
You sound very poor. Are you a student?

00:07:52.012 --> 00:07:54.890
Yes, I rent an apartment nearby.

00:07:55.474 --> 00:08:00.104
I'm poor, but I'm also trying
to save money.

00:08:00.187 --> 00:08:01.730
Nobody's asking.

00:08:02.981 --> 00:08:05.025
I'm thirsty, Grandma.

00:08:05.109 --> 00:08:07.027
Barley tea or water?

00:08:07.111 --> 00:08:08.779
-Barley tea.
-Okay.

00:08:08.862 --> 00:08:10.947
Just a second.

00:08:11.031 --> 00:08:12.574
Allow me.

00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:16.495
It's okay. Don't let your food get cold.

00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:18.080
Is this it?

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:22.168
Here.

00:08:23.419 --> 00:08:24.795
You're pretty demanding.

00:08:25.462 --> 00:08:27.339
Ouch, that's hot!

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.469
What's the deal?

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:36.932
Kumiko can't hold onto tea in a cup.

00:08:37.891 --> 00:08:41.687
How about a plastic bottle? Or a thermos.

00:08:42.896 --> 00:08:44.315
You're a funny young man.

00:08:46.358 --> 00:08:47.901
Thank you for the meal.

00:08:48.527 --> 00:08:50.071
Sorry for staying so long.

00:08:50.154 --> 00:08:53.365
Nonsense. We don't often have guests.

00:08:53.449 --> 00:08:54.283
Goodbye.

00:08:57.328 --> 00:09:00.038
Do you want to earn some money?

00:09:01.915 --> 00:09:03.209
A new job?

00:09:03.792 --> 00:09:06.753
Yeah, someone I happened to meet.

00:09:06.837 --> 00:09:08.422
It pays really well.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.799
What about this job?

00:09:11.383 --> 00:09:12.718
I'll continue, of course.

00:09:14.511 --> 00:09:17.598
Where's the joy in working so much?

00:09:17.681 --> 00:09:21.477
I can introduce you too. She's a female.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.019
-Seriously?
-Yes.

00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:24.896
About 80 years old.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.148
Figures.

00:09:26.732 --> 00:09:28.984
Move those hands, Hayato.

00:09:29.067 --> 00:09:30.152
Yes, boss.

00:09:32.028 --> 00:09:33.905
Have you seen the toolbox?

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:38.452
Yeah, the lid needed fixing.

00:09:38.535 --> 00:09:39.411
Hey, thanks!

00:09:41.788 --> 00:09:46.042
I might even hire you full-time
when you graduate.

00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:47.836
I'll think about it.

00:09:47.919 --> 00:09:50.756
Not you. I meant Tsuneo Suzukawa here.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.718
I plan to study abroad after college.

00:09:55.802 --> 00:10:00.516
Didn't you know, boss?
He's going to the Netherlands.

00:10:00.599 --> 00:10:01.850
It's Mexico.

00:10:01.933 --> 00:10:06.730
Ah, Mexico. I once swam
with a baby sea lion in La Paz.

00:10:07.523 --> 00:10:11.485
Study abroad, huh?
We're going to miss you.

00:10:12.068 --> 00:10:14.821
I haven't found a school yet.

00:10:14.905 --> 00:10:19.993
And he hasn't saved enough.
You should raise his wages.

00:10:20.076 --> 00:10:21.620
Mine too, while you're at it.

00:10:21.703 --> 00:10:23.497
Go check the machines.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:24.956
Right away, sir!

00:10:26.583 --> 00:10:28.043
What's wrong, Mai?

00:10:28.126 --> 00:10:33.340
Nothing. Well, tell me
about that job that pays so well.

00:10:33.424 --> 00:10:35.967
You are to do as Kumiko says.

00:10:36.927 --> 00:10:37.761
What?

00:10:37.844 --> 00:10:39.638
Didn't I tell you?

00:10:39.721 --> 00:10:44.059
No, you didn't.
You mean I'd be working here?

00:10:44.726 --> 00:10:46.770
Yes, you'd be working here.

00:10:49.523 --> 00:10:52.025
Don't look so disappointed.

00:10:52.108 --> 00:10:56.655
There's only one rule.
Don't take her out on your own.

00:10:57.406 --> 00:10:59.783
Help yourself to anything in the fridge.

00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:01.910
There's plenty.

00:11:02.578 --> 00:11:06.081
I have to go.
Kumiko will tell you what to do.

00:11:06.707 --> 00:11:08.209
Where are you going?

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:20.178
Well… hello.

00:11:21.972 --> 00:11:22.973
What do I do?

00:11:25.601 --> 00:11:26.477
Joan, was it?

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.436
It's Josee!

00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:33.817
-Josee?
-Stay away.

00:11:38.614 --> 00:11:41.367
"Intruders get out", he says.

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:45.246
But I'm working here from today.

00:11:46.997 --> 00:11:48.081
-Kneel.
-What?

00:11:48.582 --> 00:11:49.625
On your knees.

00:11:51.335 --> 00:11:52.168
Okay, I'm kneeling.

00:11:57.383 --> 00:11:58.759
Do you want to live?

00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:03.013
Why am I kneeling?

00:12:03.096 --> 00:12:06.182
To see how long a human can endure it.

00:12:07.309 --> 00:12:08.935
Do your job well.

00:12:13.732 --> 00:12:16.234
I'm going to make her cry.

00:12:16.318 --> 00:12:20.155
Your look has really changed
in the past month.

00:12:20.739 --> 00:12:23.492
Is working for this Josee that hard?

00:12:23.575 --> 00:12:25.661
It's way beyond hard.

00:12:26.328 --> 00:12:27.746
Count the meshes in the tatami mats.

00:12:29.122 --> 00:12:32.250
It keeps me up at night wondering.

00:12:33.377 --> 00:12:36.755
5,208, 5,209, 5,210,

00:12:37.339 --> 00:12:40.342
5,211, 5,212…

00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:42.761
Oh, what a waste.

00:12:43.387 --> 00:12:47.098
I squandered 8,000 yen
on a bad pachinko machine.

00:12:47.182 --> 00:12:50.602
8,001, 8,002, 8,003… Oops.

00:12:50.686 --> 00:12:52.145
Start over.

00:12:55.231 --> 00:12:57.568
Bring me four-leaf clovers.

00:12:59.027 --> 00:13:01.572
Four-leaf clovers.

00:13:02.155 --> 00:13:04.825
Four-leaf clovers…

00:13:05.784 --> 00:13:07.118
Here.

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:09.663
Nothing's happening.

00:13:11.332 --> 00:13:13.917
Ten are supposed to grant my wish.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.043
Superstition.

00:13:15.711 --> 00:13:16.962
What wish?

00:13:17.045 --> 00:13:19.381
Don't speak to me. I'm busy.

00:13:23.093 --> 00:13:25.512
She looks so meek

00:13:25.596 --> 00:13:29.516
until she speaks
and becomes a stinging jellyfish.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.645
I'd like to glue her
to one of her sliding doors.

00:13:33.729 --> 00:13:35.188
Oh, harsh.

00:13:35.271 --> 00:13:40.068
Why don't you quit?
You need to write your thesis.

00:13:40.902 --> 00:13:43.447
But I really need the money.

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:46.241
You don't have to earn it there.

00:13:46.825 --> 00:13:49.703
Even if your hours
at the shop are decreasing.

00:13:50.787 --> 00:13:53.081
Stop thinking about making a buck

00:13:53.164 --> 00:13:56.251
and give some attention to Mai.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.504
Eat this and shut up.

00:14:02.298 --> 00:14:03.842
Is Tsuneo here?

00:14:04.551 --> 00:14:05.386
Professor!

00:14:06.052 --> 00:14:08.930
There you are. Can you spare a second?

00:14:10.974 --> 00:14:13.519
Your essay on Turing Patterns.

00:14:14.227 --> 00:14:18.440
I sent it to a professor
at Mexico City University.

00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:22.444
He loved it and wants you to study there.

00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:23.737
Thank you!

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.783
That leaves the question of a scholarship.

00:14:27.866 --> 00:14:31.369
It'll be hard to pay your own way.

00:14:31.953 --> 00:14:33.664
I'll study Spanish harder,

00:14:33.747 --> 00:14:38.209
and rewrite my research proposal.

00:14:38.293 --> 00:14:40.796
Okay, don't push yourself too hard.

00:14:40.879 --> 00:14:43.048
You'll need your health.

00:14:43.757 --> 00:14:45.509
Otherwise, all will be lost.

00:14:46.885 --> 00:14:47.719
Okay.

00:16:24.149 --> 00:16:25.942
I thought you were asleep.

00:16:27.861 --> 00:16:31.489
Grandma, can we resume our walks?

00:16:31.573 --> 00:16:32.448
No.

00:16:33.033 --> 00:16:35.285
What if you get pushed again?

00:16:35.869 --> 00:16:39.205
Can you protect yourself?

00:16:40.456 --> 00:16:42.042
Listen to me. The world…

00:16:42.626 --> 00:16:44.795
-is full of scary beasts.
-Is full of scary beasts.

00:16:45.295 --> 00:16:46.880
Yes, I know that.

00:16:48.256 --> 00:16:50.676
Then be content to stay home.

00:16:58.058 --> 00:17:01.812
I envy you. Free to go where you choose.

00:17:06.482 --> 00:17:08.401
Nothing will happen from waiting.

00:17:23.333 --> 00:17:24.209
Hello!

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:42.853
I'll miss the money, but Hayato is right.

00:17:49.943 --> 00:17:52.362
Listen, I've come to a decision.

00:17:54.948 --> 00:17:56.992
I need to quit this job.

00:18:00.453 --> 00:18:01.287
Are you listening?

00:18:36.698 --> 00:18:38.158
Kumiko!

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.787
Kumiko!

00:18:44.039 --> 00:18:45.415
What's wrong?

00:18:45.498 --> 00:18:47.542
Kumiko is missing!

00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:03.641
Stop!

00:19:04.935 --> 00:19:06.436
What are you doing?

00:19:07.062 --> 00:19:08.772
None of your business!

00:19:11.316 --> 00:19:12.859
Let me go!

00:19:16.696 --> 00:19:17.739
What, by yourself?

00:19:29.125 --> 00:19:30.877
-Let's call it a day.
-Take me.

00:19:32.921 --> 00:19:34.547
Take me to the sea.

00:19:35.423 --> 00:19:38.760
Or I'll say you
groped my breasts and get you fired.

00:19:41.096 --> 00:19:43.890
Do what you want. I'm going home.

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.074
This will cost extra.

00:20:08.957 --> 00:20:10.375
280 yen.

00:20:11.334 --> 00:20:13.879
For the ticket. I've got a railcard.

00:20:15.296 --> 00:20:16.131
Is something wrong?

00:20:16.214 --> 00:20:17.757
No, it's nothing.

00:20:19.675 --> 00:20:23.554
It's Tsuneo. I've found Kumiko.

00:20:25.306 --> 00:20:26.141
Excuse me.

00:20:35.191 --> 00:20:39.821
I'll have her back
as soon as I can. Please understand.

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:45.576
-Tiger.
-What?

00:20:46.286 --> 00:20:47.537
Tigers everywhere.

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:48.830
Tigers?

00:20:52.542 --> 00:20:53.501
Hey.

00:20:53.584 --> 00:20:54.627
Where to now?

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:55.545
Home.

00:20:56.337 --> 00:20:58.048
What about the sea?

00:20:58.631 --> 00:21:00.175
You were so insistent.

00:21:01.717 --> 00:21:03.178
Watch where you're going!

00:21:03.761 --> 00:21:05.889
What? She bumped into me.

00:21:09.059 --> 00:21:12.103
Are you serious? What a jerk.

00:21:13.229 --> 00:21:14.647
Hey, watch it!!

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:15.565
Yes, Granny.

00:21:15.648 --> 00:21:18.734
Mess with me and I'll rip out your heart

00:21:18.818 --> 00:21:19.903
and feed it to you!

00:21:20.904 --> 00:21:21.737
Sorry!

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.916
What do you want to do, Ms. Josee?

00:21:33.749 --> 00:21:35.418
Are we going or not?

00:21:46.262 --> 00:21:47.097
Be careful.

00:21:52.185 --> 00:21:53.186
Not there?

00:21:53.269 --> 00:21:54.604
No, it's this way.

00:21:54.687 --> 00:21:55.855
Really?

00:21:57.941 --> 00:21:59.525
Now, where's the elevator?

00:22:00.151 --> 00:22:02.112
Why are there so many people?

00:22:02.195 --> 00:22:03.529
Beats me.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:15.166
It's not my first time on a train.

00:22:17.085 --> 00:22:18.628
Stop staring.

00:22:18.711 --> 00:22:23.216
No, I was just wondering
how you see the world.

00:22:24.926 --> 00:22:27.929
Forests, deserts, New York, Paris…

00:22:28.596 --> 00:22:30.806
I've never imagined them that way.

00:22:31.975 --> 00:22:33.726
The way you drew them.

00:22:33.809 --> 00:22:35.937
You went into my room?

00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:39.440
I'd like to see an ocean like that.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.323
Pretty cocky for a servant.

00:22:48.199 --> 00:22:49.242
A servant?

00:22:49.325 --> 00:22:52.328
From today, you're "My Servant."

00:22:52.412 --> 00:22:53.496
What is that?

00:22:54.455 --> 00:22:55.540
Look! An airplane!

00:22:55.623 --> 00:22:59.210
Really? Where? Point it out to me.

00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:42.837
It's like a dream.

00:23:53.014 --> 00:23:54.849
Give it up. It's sand.

00:23:57.518 --> 00:23:58.353
You okay?

00:23:59.895 --> 00:24:01.356
Take it easy.

00:24:04.692 --> 00:24:05.526
Hey!

00:24:07.612 --> 00:24:09.364
I need an answer.

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:16.787
My dad once asked me,
"How does the sea taste?"

00:24:18.498 --> 00:24:23.336
When I was a child,
he took me to the ocean.

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:27.507
But the waves were too scary to get near.

00:24:29.467 --> 00:24:34.055
My dad died without
ever telling me the answer to it.

00:24:36.432 --> 00:24:41.354
Of course, I learned
from books that the sea is salty.

00:24:43.189 --> 00:24:45.983
But this may be
my only chance to confirm it.

00:24:57.036 --> 00:24:59.164
What are you doing?

00:24:59.247 --> 00:25:02.208
Put me down, you pervert!

00:25:02.833 --> 00:25:04.544
You want to see for yourself?

00:25:16.055 --> 00:25:16.889
Salty.

00:25:19.559 --> 00:25:21.144
It really is salty!

00:25:21.727 --> 00:25:23.229
Why is it so salty?

00:25:23.979 --> 00:25:25.148
I'm happy for you.

00:25:28.526 --> 00:25:29.902
Hey, stay still!

00:25:29.985 --> 00:25:31.612
It's really salty!

00:25:43.208 --> 00:25:44.417
Stop!

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.007
NO GOING OUT!

00:25:52.592 --> 00:25:55.386
You said you'd come right back.

00:25:59.182 --> 00:26:00.891
Do it again, and you'll lose this.

00:26:01.642 --> 00:26:02.477
Sorry.

00:26:10.776 --> 00:26:12.069
Why did you come with me?

00:26:16.073 --> 00:26:19.827
I have a weakness
for anyone longing for the sea.

00:26:21.371 --> 00:26:24.832
I love seeing schools of fish swimming,

00:26:24.915 --> 00:26:26.209
so I often go diving.

00:26:27.293 --> 00:26:29.337
I even work at a diving shop.

00:26:30.546 --> 00:26:32.340
You've swum underwater?

00:26:32.923 --> 00:26:34.133
Alongside real fish?

00:26:34.925 --> 00:26:35.760
Yeah.

00:26:37.052 --> 00:26:38.346
Wow.

00:26:41.432 --> 00:26:44.727
Tell me, are there
other places you want to go?

00:26:47.397 --> 00:26:50.983
Grandma takes a nap between one and three.

00:27:29.772 --> 00:27:31.816
First crepe ever?

00:27:33.401 --> 00:27:36.279
No, I've eaten many with my boyfriends.

00:27:37.572 --> 00:27:39.114
I'm popular with boys.

00:27:39.198 --> 00:27:41.784
I've had five boyfriends at once.

00:27:41.867 --> 00:27:42.743
Sure.

00:27:53.045 --> 00:27:54.339
Ready and…

00:28:02.305 --> 00:28:03.138
You okay?

00:28:06.851 --> 00:28:09.354
So many different blues!

00:28:11.689 --> 00:28:12.732
Let's ride that!

00:28:12.815 --> 00:28:14.359
No, wait!

00:28:14.442 --> 00:28:15.485
Hurry up!

00:28:16.068 --> 00:28:19.280
This is amazing! Where's my house?

00:28:19.364 --> 00:28:22.367
Osaka Castle? Tell me, My Servant.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.580
Afraid of heights?

00:28:43.304 --> 00:28:44.221
There.

00:28:45.097 --> 00:28:48.142
Guess what, Grandma. I made dinner.

00:28:48.225 --> 00:28:49.184
You what?

00:28:51.521 --> 00:28:53.398
Yukichi, come here.

00:28:54.189 --> 00:28:55.232
Yukichi?

00:28:56.233 --> 00:28:57.360
Yeah, I named him.

00:28:57.443 --> 00:28:58.319
Well, you can't!

00:28:59.194 --> 00:29:01.906
-Make this chair two millimeters higher.
-What?

00:29:09.204 --> 00:29:10.623
That wasn't bad.

00:29:10.706 --> 00:29:11.916
Like I told you.

00:29:19.882 --> 00:29:21.300
Stop that!

00:29:21.967 --> 00:29:23.761
Easy.

00:29:30.184 --> 00:29:32.770
Slow down!

00:29:37.442 --> 00:29:39.318
We're in the sea.

00:29:39.944 --> 00:29:41.070
A seal!

00:29:41.153 --> 00:29:42.572
California sea lion.

00:29:43.155 --> 00:29:44.239
It's got horns.

00:29:44.323 --> 00:29:45.450
It's a Naso unicornis.

00:29:45.533 --> 00:29:47.326
Look at the big one!

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:48.494
Whale shark.

00:29:49.078 --> 00:29:50.329
What's that group?

00:29:50.413 --> 00:29:51.456
Horse mackerel.

00:29:52.122 --> 00:29:54.208
One type sticks to reefs,

00:29:54.291 --> 00:29:57.545
but another type swims in the open seas.

00:29:57.628 --> 00:30:00.381
The latter form unique schools

00:30:00.465 --> 00:30:03.092
at middle to low ocean depths.

00:30:03.175 --> 00:30:05.511
They differ in shape, color, and habitat.

00:30:05.595 --> 00:30:08.681
Gold and black mackerel stick to reefs.

00:30:08.764 --> 00:30:10.975
Rockfish take to the open sea.

00:30:27.825 --> 00:30:30.536
It's a job opportunity for Kumiko.

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:32.371
You're as pesky as the rest.

00:30:34.248 --> 00:30:37.126
She must be able
to live an independent life.

00:30:37.209 --> 00:30:41.005
You're supposed to support, not lecture.

00:30:41.088 --> 00:30:43.799
I'm sick and tired of hearing that.

00:30:45.551 --> 00:30:48.303
Keeping her confined to the home

00:30:48.387 --> 00:30:50.890
is not in her best interests.

00:30:51.807 --> 00:30:55.936
I'd bet her departed parents
are worried too.

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.480
What do you know?

00:30:59.857 --> 00:31:02.860
I refuse to take Kumiko outside.

00:31:05.446 --> 00:31:08.741
But she goes out a lot lately.

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:12.662
She thinks I don't know.

00:31:12.745 --> 00:31:13.788
By herself?

00:31:16.331 --> 00:31:20.210
I honestly didn't think
he'd take her to places.

00:31:20.294 --> 00:31:21.796
I was flabbergasted.

00:31:22.379 --> 00:31:25.508
You'd be surprised if you saw her now.

00:31:26.008 --> 00:31:29.178
She looks like that Glico billboard.

00:31:29.261 --> 00:31:30.095
Sorry?

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:35.893
Ready to take off at a sprint.

00:31:39.772 --> 00:31:42.608
MACARTHUR'S ASSASSIN
RED SEA

00:31:43.984 --> 00:31:45.235
It's a sea of books.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:01.794
"Josee"?

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:05.923
Oh, it's you, My Servant.

00:32:06.924 --> 00:32:08.258
Does that say "Josee"?

00:32:09.218 --> 00:32:11.220
It's the main character's name.

00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:14.515
Francoise Sagan.

00:32:16.266 --> 00:32:18.853
That's the sequel to this one,

00:32:18.936 --> 00:32:21.939
the conclusion I've longed to read.

00:32:23.107 --> 00:32:25.400
Hmm, it'll put me to sleep.

00:32:26.694 --> 00:32:29.572
I wouldn't expect a boorish servant

00:32:29.655 --> 00:32:30.823
to understand Sagan.

00:32:31.699 --> 00:32:33.117
Go borrow these.

00:32:34.785 --> 00:32:36.286
We need a library card.

00:32:37.955 --> 00:32:40.124
LOST PROFILE

00:32:41.667 --> 00:32:43.252
First time?

00:32:44.837 --> 00:32:47.089
Please fill out this form.

00:32:51.844 --> 00:32:53.428
Do you like Sagan?

00:33:00.978 --> 00:33:02.312
So do I!

00:33:02.396 --> 00:33:04.231
Which is your favorite?

00:33:07.151 --> 00:33:10.738
Sorry, I never meet other Sagan fans.

00:33:10.821 --> 00:33:12.114
I got a little excited.

00:33:14.909 --> 00:33:17.494
Those Without Shadows.

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:19.830
Cool.

00:33:20.414 --> 00:33:24.001
Have you read The Unmade Bed?
The protagonist is Beatrice

00:33:24.084 --> 00:33:26.211
-from Those Without Shadows.
-Josee, borrow them both.

00:33:27.755 --> 00:33:28.589
Boyfriend?

00:33:29.423 --> 00:33:32.176
He called you "Josee." How wonderful.

00:33:34.386 --> 00:33:37.389
No! He's not my boyfriend or anything!

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:40.184
She wouldn't waste time on me.

00:33:40.726 --> 00:33:42.477
Boys like her.

00:33:42.561 --> 00:33:44.814
She had five boyfriends at once.

00:33:44.897 --> 00:33:46.982
Shut up. I'll beat you senseless.

00:33:50.485 --> 00:33:53.739
But I'd like to read
the book you were mentioning.

00:33:53.823 --> 00:33:55.324
Yes, about Beatrice.

00:33:58.744 --> 00:34:00.287
You made a friend.

00:34:00.913 --> 00:34:01.789
A friend?

00:34:02.372 --> 00:34:03.582
The librarian.

00:34:03.666 --> 00:34:06.501
Kana and I are already friends?

00:34:06.585 --> 00:34:08.295
It looked like it to me.

00:34:15.302 --> 00:34:17.972
Kana and I are the same age.

00:34:18.764 --> 00:34:20.432
How old is that?

00:34:20.515 --> 00:34:21.433
Twenty-four.

00:34:21.516 --> 00:34:22.727
What? You're older…

00:34:23.686 --> 00:34:28.440
I mean, wow.
So you and Kana are the same age?

00:34:29.566 --> 00:34:31.235
It must be amazing to talk

00:34:31.944 --> 00:34:34.321
to a lot of people every day.

00:34:34.947 --> 00:34:36.741
You get used to it.

00:34:37.324 --> 00:34:40.452
I meet lots of customers
at the diving shop.

00:34:41.036 --> 00:34:42.037
Really?

00:34:45.708 --> 00:34:47.793
-Hey, it's Tsuneo…
-Hey.

00:34:53.841 --> 00:34:55.843
You must be Josee.

00:34:58.804 --> 00:35:01.306
Perfect strike.

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:05.728
Hi, I'm Tsuneo's oldest
and dearest friend,

00:35:05.811 --> 00:35:06.979
Hayato Matsuura.

00:35:07.897 --> 00:35:09.273
What social media do you use?

00:35:09.356 --> 00:35:10.524
Easy, Hayato.

00:35:11.108 --> 00:35:12.735
I don't have one.

00:35:15.946 --> 00:35:19.616
She's a fairy. Living in analog!

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:20.534
Knock it off.

00:35:21.118 --> 00:35:21.994
What'll we do?

00:35:22.662 --> 00:35:24.329
Sorry, I'll be right back.

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:28.751
Welcome, ladies. Come in.

00:35:28.834 --> 00:35:30.627
You don't have to worry about him.

00:35:30.711 --> 00:35:32.129
Welcome. This way.

00:35:32.713 --> 00:35:35.049
Please take a seat.

00:35:40.345 --> 00:35:42.056
Tsuneo, you're here.

00:35:42.639 --> 00:35:43.808
Just passing by.

00:35:45.267 --> 00:35:47.602
How can I help you today?

00:35:47.687 --> 00:35:50.773
We want to get our diving licenses.

00:35:50.856 --> 00:35:51.732
I see.

00:35:52.482 --> 00:35:55.027
How do you do? I'm Mai Ninomiya.

00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:57.196
Tsuneo's told me a lot about you.

00:35:59.907 --> 00:36:03.493
If there's anything you need, please ask.

00:36:06.789 --> 00:36:09.875
Oh, yesterday I saw a clown frogfish!

00:36:10.459 --> 00:36:12.419
You took the photo yourself?

00:36:12.502 --> 00:36:15.297
No, the strong swell kept interfering.

00:36:17.049 --> 00:36:17.883
I want to leave.

00:36:18.884 --> 00:36:19.927
We just got here.

00:36:22.137 --> 00:36:23.055
Josee?

00:36:24.389 --> 00:36:25.224
Sorry.

00:36:28.728 --> 00:36:31.230
Did Josee leave already?

00:36:31.313 --> 00:36:33.232
What a rare beauty.

00:36:33.315 --> 00:36:36.736
Pale skin, modest, cute, and delicate…

00:36:36.819 --> 00:36:39.071
Get back to work.

00:36:39.822 --> 00:36:40.865
What's wrong?

00:36:40.948 --> 00:36:42.574
Nothing!

00:36:42.657 --> 00:36:45.995
You wanted to see where I work.

00:36:49.206 --> 00:36:51.666
I don't like places like this.

00:36:52.626 --> 00:36:53.668
Places like this?

00:36:56.797 --> 00:36:59.133
I don't know what there is to hate.

00:36:59.216 --> 00:37:00.175
You wouldn't!

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.219
That's right. I don't!

00:37:17.234 --> 00:37:18.068
No, thanks.

00:37:20.404 --> 00:37:21.781
But alone, you…

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:28.620
Tell him not to come anymore.

00:37:30.455 --> 00:37:31.456
What happened?

00:37:32.041 --> 00:37:33.417
Just tell him.

00:37:35.127 --> 00:37:36.879
All right, I will.

00:37:42.759 --> 00:37:44.636
I'm a mess, Yukichi.

00:37:50.392 --> 00:37:52.144
I don't have to come?

00:37:54.479 --> 00:37:55.605
I understand.

00:38:02.779 --> 00:38:04.907
No, I don't understand!

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:18.045
Like that? I'm really proud of it.

00:38:23.467 --> 00:38:24.634
This here…

00:38:27.179 --> 00:38:28.013
Sorry.

00:38:29.181 --> 00:38:30.140
What is it?

00:38:32.642 --> 00:38:36.646
I've been granted
a scholarship to study abroad!

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:40.442
That's great! When do you go?

00:38:40.525 --> 00:38:41.944
Next March.

00:38:42.527 --> 00:38:44.613
School starts in September,

00:38:45.114 --> 00:38:48.868
but they want me to come after I graduate.

00:38:48.951 --> 00:38:53.747
I guess we'll only have
six more months working together.

00:38:58.919 --> 00:39:00.670
You've been coming alone lately.

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:02.464
Where's Tsuneo?

00:39:04.799 --> 00:39:07.011
Who cares about that dunderhead?

00:39:07.636 --> 00:39:08.971
Dunderhead?

00:39:09.554 --> 00:39:12.474
He's useless and takes up a lot of space.

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.852
He eats like he's starving
and flirts with girls.

00:39:15.936 --> 00:39:17.104
JAPANESE NOVELS

00:39:17.187 --> 00:39:18.272
What's so funny?

00:39:19.064 --> 00:39:21.984
Sorry, but you're just so obvious.

00:39:22.567 --> 00:39:24.236
What's obvious?

00:39:24.319 --> 00:39:25.445
Kana!

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:26.906
Hi, Rio!

00:39:28.823 --> 00:39:29.658
Read this.

00:39:31.201 --> 00:39:32.244
What's wrong?

00:39:32.327 --> 00:39:36.498
I always read to kids at this time of day.

00:39:37.124 --> 00:39:40.002
But a worker just quit on us.

00:39:40.085 --> 00:39:41.628
Anyone here?

00:39:41.711 --> 00:39:42.546
Coming!

00:39:43.213 --> 00:39:44.089
I'm sorry.

00:39:50.971 --> 00:39:52.056
Will you read to us?

00:39:57.102 --> 00:39:59.939
The Little Mermaid.

00:40:00.022 --> 00:40:02.816
This lady is going to read to us!

00:40:06.611 --> 00:40:08.238
I don't think I can…

00:40:08.322 --> 00:40:09.364
Hurry and read.

00:40:09.448 --> 00:40:10.824
-Hurry.
-We're waiting.

00:40:10.907 --> 00:40:12.367
-Keep reading.
-Please.

00:40:12.451 --> 00:40:14.078
-What's wrong?
-Come on.

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:20.250
"On the bed of a limpid,

00:40:20.334 --> 00:40:22.877
blue sea stood a pearl palace,

00:40:22.962 --> 00:40:26.173
where six princess mermaids lived."

00:40:27.382 --> 00:40:31.636
"They loved to listen
to the king tell stories

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:36.475
about the world they'd see
above the waves as adults."

00:40:36.558 --> 00:40:39.478
"The sky, birds,
exotic things, city lights."

00:40:40.062 --> 00:40:43.482
"The princesses waited
with eager anticipation

00:40:43.565 --> 00:40:45.234
for that day to come."

00:40:45.817 --> 00:40:47.402
"'Farewell, good prince,'

00:40:47.486 --> 00:40:50.447
the mermaid said, tossing her knife."

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:53.367
"And she dove into the sea,

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:57.246
where her body melted away into bubbles."

00:41:02.584 --> 00:41:04.836
I can't read stories very well.

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:07.256
Question!

00:41:07.881 --> 00:41:10.467
What did her palace look like?

00:41:24.314 --> 00:41:26.525
Look, the mermaid palace!

00:41:28.068 --> 00:41:30.612
It really looks like a mermaid home.

00:41:32.239 --> 00:41:34.824
Josee, you're an illustrator?

00:41:34.908 --> 00:41:36.243
No way!

00:41:36.326 --> 00:41:39.121
What a shame it would be

00:41:39.204 --> 00:41:41.998
for people not to see your art.

00:41:42.582 --> 00:41:46.045
I think you should
put together a collection

00:41:46.128 --> 00:41:47.796
and get them published!

00:41:47.879 --> 00:41:48.713
I can't!

00:41:52.634 --> 00:41:53.468
Sorry.

00:42:00.059 --> 00:42:00.892
Good evening.

00:42:03.019 --> 00:42:05.897
Go home! No dunderheads allowed!

00:42:10.944 --> 00:42:12.071
What are you doing?

00:42:21.996 --> 00:42:23.748
It's pretty good, right?

00:42:25.292 --> 00:42:26.835
You made it, My Servant?

00:42:27.711 --> 00:42:29.338
Yes, Your Servant made it.

00:42:31.298 --> 00:42:33.342
No wonder it's so ugly.

00:42:36.761 --> 00:42:37.929
What's it called?

00:42:38.763 --> 00:42:39.806
It's a clarion angel.

00:42:41.308 --> 00:42:44.269
A rare species found only near Mexico.

00:42:46.105 --> 00:42:50.442
When I was a kid,
my local fish store had one,

00:42:51.067 --> 00:42:52.402
and I fell in love with it.

00:42:53.903 --> 00:42:57.824
I'd go to look at it
every day after school.

00:42:59.534 --> 00:43:02.246
When I learned it swam in schools,

00:43:02.329 --> 00:43:03.622
my interest grew more.

00:43:05.081 --> 00:43:08.293
It wants to be with family too.

00:43:09.628 --> 00:43:10.462
What do you mean?

00:43:10.962 --> 00:43:12.881
My parents are divorced.

00:43:14.216 --> 00:43:18.137
Dad left home, and Mom
was always busy working.

00:43:19.471 --> 00:43:23.683
I don't think he was sad,
though, the clarion angel.

00:43:25.059 --> 00:43:27.354
He had you come every day.

00:43:30.274 --> 00:43:33.860
I've long dreamed
of seeing him swimming in a school.

00:43:35.404 --> 00:43:38.615
It's why I've studied so hard
and saved money.

00:43:39.324 --> 00:43:41.117
They're hard to find

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:44.204
so a brief diving vacation wouldn't do.

00:43:46.498 --> 00:43:47.624
It's a nice dream.

00:43:50.001 --> 00:43:51.420
I hope it comes true.

00:43:57.091 --> 00:43:58.843
Actually, next year…

00:44:00.387 --> 00:44:01.388
This is defective.

00:44:01.471 --> 00:44:02.764
That's odd.

00:44:06.435 --> 00:44:07.477
There, all fixed.

00:44:23.785 --> 00:44:25.870
That hurts!

00:44:25.954 --> 00:44:28.498
Why the heck did you do that?

00:44:48.643 --> 00:44:49.478
Hello!

00:44:56.818 --> 00:44:57.944
Ready to go?

00:45:04.618 --> 00:45:05.452
Kumiko!

00:45:08.663 --> 00:45:11.416
Grandma, the world isn't all scary.

00:45:50.414 --> 00:45:51.956
I'm going to have nightmares.

00:45:52.541 --> 00:45:55.377
Nightmares? You came to see this.

00:45:56.002 --> 00:45:59.964
I wanted to see
the scariest thing here with you.

00:46:02.801 --> 00:46:05.387
I thought I could do it
with you by my side.

00:46:06.137 --> 00:46:07.013
With me by your side?

00:46:15.188 --> 00:46:16.147
To hold onto.

00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:22.278
I needed something
to hold onto if I got scared.

00:46:27.701 --> 00:46:28.785
That hurts.

00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:37.336
I read a story aloud
to children the other day.

00:46:37.419 --> 00:46:39.295
You, Josee? What was it?

00:46:40.046 --> 00:46:41.172
The Little Mermaid.

00:46:41.255 --> 00:46:43.216
Wow, that's amazing.

00:46:45.301 --> 00:46:46.636
I didn't read it very well.

00:46:47.346 --> 00:46:49.931
I got so nervous, I couldn't look up.

00:46:51.850 --> 00:46:52.809
It was scary.

00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:57.731
But then I drew a picture,

00:46:57.814 --> 00:46:59.399
and the children all loved it.

00:47:02.318 --> 00:47:04.237
I want to draw more.

00:47:04.904 --> 00:47:05.739
More?

00:47:06.239 --> 00:47:09.534
As a job. I want to draw professionally.

00:47:11.661 --> 00:47:13.079
I want to give it a shot.

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:15.206
Like what you're doing.

00:47:18.918 --> 00:47:20.420
Well, I love…

00:47:21.546 --> 00:47:22.381
your drawings.

00:47:24.591 --> 00:47:26.510
Pretty cocky for a servant.

00:47:29.429 --> 00:47:32.766
Cherry blossoms fall
like rain here in spring.

00:47:33.392 --> 00:47:35.394
My dad used to bring me.

00:47:36.728 --> 00:47:38.104
It must be beautiful.

00:47:39.355 --> 00:47:43.359
If you want to see it,
you can bring me next year.

00:47:45.862 --> 00:47:46.696
What's wrong?

00:47:49.157 --> 00:47:49.991
Nothing.

00:48:23.232 --> 00:48:26.069
Did you hear about Ms. Yamamura?

00:48:26.152 --> 00:48:29.489
She's had a bad heart for some time.

00:48:30.364 --> 00:48:32.492
And she was quite old.

00:48:32.576 --> 00:48:35.579
CHIZU YAMAMURA

00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:45.714
The morticians left.

00:48:48.257 --> 00:48:50.301
If you need to talk, I'm here.

00:48:51.553 --> 00:48:53.012
About what to do next.

00:48:56.475 --> 00:49:00.479
Grandma left me a little money to live on.

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:03.064
I'll be okay for a while.

00:49:04.524 --> 00:49:05.358
I see.

00:49:07.193 --> 00:49:09.445
But I can't afford to pay.

00:49:11.447 --> 00:49:14.784
I can't pay My Servant wages.

00:49:19.789 --> 00:49:20.624
I understand.

00:50:08.797 --> 00:50:11.174
OUT OF OXYGEN

00:50:37.742 --> 00:50:40.662
It's rare for you
to lose track of oxygen, Tsuneo.

00:50:41.746 --> 00:50:43.790
You seem distracted.

00:50:43.873 --> 00:50:46.209
I know. You confessed--

00:50:48.587 --> 00:50:50.630
Josee's grandmother died.

00:50:52.423 --> 00:50:55.384
So now she's all alone.

00:50:56.219 --> 00:50:57.929
That's pretty harsh.

00:50:58.638 --> 00:51:00.431
And worrying.

00:51:02.851 --> 00:51:05.061
She's not a child,

00:51:05.561 --> 00:51:08.106
and there are welfare services
and facilities.

00:51:13.319 --> 00:51:15.029
"Free yourself from life."

00:51:15.989 --> 00:51:18.700
"From that which others call life."

00:51:19.242 --> 00:51:20.284
"Be free from emotion,

00:51:20.994 --> 00:51:24.538
from one's strengths,
one's own weaknesses."

00:51:25.123 --> 00:51:27.291
"Be but one momentary breath,

00:51:27.375 --> 00:51:31.212
one-millionth of a billion nebulas."

00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:40.554
Are you home, Ms. Kumiko? It's Mizushima.

00:51:44.851 --> 00:51:47.561
This is Mr. Fujita, a social worker.

00:51:48.312 --> 00:51:54.277
The resident's association chairman
got a call from one of your neighbors.

00:51:54.861 --> 00:51:57.530
They heard your grandmother passed

00:51:57.613 --> 00:51:59.615
and felt you needed assistance.

00:52:00.992 --> 00:52:02.201
It's none of their business.

00:52:04.537 --> 00:52:07.832
How do you plan to move forward?

00:52:09.542 --> 00:52:10.376
Pictures.

00:52:12.461 --> 00:52:14.630
I plan to draw pictures.

00:52:17.466 --> 00:52:22.263
You're saying you'll earn
a living as an artist?

00:52:23.222 --> 00:52:26.517
I think it's wonderful to have a dream.

00:52:27.101 --> 00:52:30.855
Dreams are one thing. Reality is another.

00:52:30.939 --> 00:52:33.482
You of all should know that.

00:52:34.067 --> 00:52:37.195
Don't be foolish. Go look for work…

00:52:38.571 --> 00:52:41.615
Your grandma's not here to dote on you.

00:52:42.742 --> 00:52:44.285
Mr. Fujita.

00:52:44.368 --> 00:52:49.708
Or is there someone else
who will support you?

00:53:11.104 --> 00:53:12.355
Are you okay?

00:53:15.233 --> 00:53:17.401
I'm Mai. We met the other day.

00:53:19.362 --> 00:53:20.196
Why are you here?

00:53:21.239 --> 00:53:25.869
I remembered Tsuneo saying
you lived by the river.

00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:31.791
It would've been faster
if we had just asked Tsuneo.

00:53:35.711 --> 00:53:36.670
What do you want?

00:53:42.761 --> 00:53:44.553
I beg you to free Tsuneo.

00:53:45.513 --> 00:53:47.849
Wait, we came to cheer her up!

00:53:47.932 --> 00:53:51.060
He's worked so hard for his dream.

00:53:51.644 --> 00:53:55.564
Studying Spanish, working to save money

00:53:56.065 --> 00:53:57.691
so he can study abroad.

00:53:58.276 --> 00:53:59.110
Study abroad?

00:53:59.735 --> 00:54:03.281
Next March, he's going to Mexico.

00:54:05.241 --> 00:54:06.242
He didn't tell you?

00:54:08.327 --> 00:54:10.621
Would you support his dream?

00:54:11.247 --> 00:54:12.290
At this rate--

00:54:12.373 --> 00:54:14.793
Why do you have to ask my permission?

00:54:16.961 --> 00:54:18.880
What's your relationship with him?

00:54:31.059 --> 00:54:31.976
It's sympathy.

00:54:33.686 --> 00:54:37.190
Tsuneo only visits you
out of pity for your condition.

00:54:38.232 --> 00:54:39.442
What the hell are you saying?

00:54:40.568 --> 00:54:41.485
Don't listen to her.

00:54:43.196 --> 00:54:44.864
Hey, wait up!

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:49.202
What types of cytoplasm do I mean?

00:54:49.285 --> 00:54:51.745
That's right, cytoplasmic genomes.

00:54:52.538 --> 00:54:56.417
You can consider them
a place to store genomes.

00:55:02.924 --> 00:55:05.259
THE LITTLE MERMAID

00:55:11.807 --> 00:55:12.683
Hello.

00:55:20.316 --> 00:55:23.486
Josee, I brought fish-shaped cakes.

00:55:26.239 --> 00:55:27.281
Why did you come?

00:55:30.659 --> 00:55:31.494
Josee?

00:55:33.412 --> 00:55:34.247
Your room…

00:55:34.788 --> 00:55:40.544
I asked a helper to come
and clean the place once a month.

00:55:41.295 --> 00:55:42.380
And your pictures?

00:55:42.463 --> 00:55:43.297
Thrown out.

00:55:43.381 --> 00:55:44.590
What? Why?

00:55:45.299 --> 00:55:47.176
None of your business.

00:55:48.136 --> 00:55:50.179
If that's all, you can go.

00:56:05.444 --> 00:56:06.570
I'll fix it right away.

00:56:16.122 --> 00:56:17.248
I want to go to the sea.

00:56:20.126 --> 00:56:22.753
This will be your last job as My Servant.

00:57:01.875 --> 00:57:03.169
Up to the waterline?

00:57:03.669 --> 00:57:04.587
This is fine.

00:57:06.714 --> 00:57:07.966
How about a warm drink?

00:57:08.466 --> 00:57:09.300
No thanks.

00:57:21.437 --> 00:57:22.271
It's salty.

00:57:27.235 --> 00:57:28.069
Josee.

00:57:34.283 --> 00:57:37.703
I don't want money.
Don't call this the last job.

00:57:38.496 --> 00:57:39.330
Josee!

00:57:41.332 --> 00:57:42.291
I'm no longer Josee.

00:57:44.377 --> 00:57:47.213
I've taken a job in an office.

00:57:48.131 --> 00:57:50.841
You didn't need to get rid of your art.

00:57:51.425 --> 00:57:52.635
It was out of reach.

00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:55.596
Everything's always out of reach.

00:57:56.972 --> 00:57:59.058
The red balloon caught on the roof.

00:57:59.933 --> 00:58:01.810
The cicada husk on the tree.

00:58:03.187 --> 00:58:05.648
Walking under an umbrella in the rain.

00:58:06.149 --> 00:58:08.859
Climbing the steps of a shrine.

00:58:10.194 --> 00:58:11.029
All of it.

00:58:13.489 --> 00:58:16.367
I no longer wish to reach for any of it.

00:58:18.244 --> 00:58:22.373
If you really don't,
then why do you look so sad?

00:58:24.542 --> 00:58:26.085
Don't give up what you love!

00:58:29.547 --> 00:58:31.049
You're leaving soon, right?

00:58:38.181 --> 00:58:39.640
The healthy wouldn't understand.

00:59:14.967 --> 00:59:16.094
Josee!

00:59:20.598 --> 00:59:21.974
Josee!

00:59:41.619 --> 00:59:42.453
My Servant…

00:59:44.079 --> 00:59:45.038
My Servant.

00:59:47.708 --> 00:59:48.834
My Servant!

00:59:49.877 --> 00:59:51.086
My Servant!

00:59:53.839 --> 00:59:57.385
Tsuneo!

01:00:04.142 --> 01:00:05.434
Are you all right?

01:00:06.644 --> 01:00:10.939
There's been a traffic accident!

01:00:20.699 --> 01:00:22.160
-Remove the scoop.
-Yes.

01:00:22.243 --> 01:00:23.202
Cutting away clothes.

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:27.290
Pulse 120, BP 70 over 40, saturation 94%.

01:00:27.373 --> 01:00:29.375
Maintain ten liters of oxygen.

01:00:29.458 --> 01:00:30.793
-Peripheral off?
-Not yet.

01:00:30.876 --> 01:00:32.920
Quickly, 18-gauge, full throttle.

01:00:33.003 --> 01:00:36.924
-Crossmatch. Don't forget the blood gas.
-Got it.

01:00:37.007 --> 01:00:38.551
X-ray standby!

01:00:39.177 --> 01:00:41.136
Airways clear, respiration's steady.

01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:42.888
Starting echo.

01:00:42.971 --> 01:00:44.515
Negative. Pneumothorax is fine.

01:00:45.766 --> 01:00:46.600
Mr. Suzukawa?

01:00:46.684 --> 01:00:50.438
Mr. Tsuneo Suzukawa? Can you hear me?

01:00:50.521 --> 01:00:53.774
If you can hear me, open your eyes.

01:01:16.714 --> 01:01:17.631
Are you awake?

01:01:18.716 --> 01:01:19.883
Yes.

01:01:19.967 --> 01:01:22.761
You were in a traffic accident.
This is a hospital.

01:01:24.263 --> 01:01:25.473
I'll call the doctor.

01:01:28.392 --> 01:01:30.936
The girl in the wheelchair?

01:01:31.019 --> 01:01:34.565
Oh, yes, we asked her to go home today.

01:01:34.648 --> 01:01:37.735
She insisted on waiting till you awoke.

01:01:38.444 --> 01:01:40.404
So she's not injured?

01:01:40.488 --> 01:01:41.322
No.

01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:45.743
How do you feel?

01:01:46.535 --> 01:01:48.371
I was in an accident?

01:01:49.162 --> 01:01:51.206
You suffered a concussion,

01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:53.751
but tests showed nothing was wrong.

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:57.212
Your internal organs are sound,

01:01:58.213 --> 01:02:01.717
but your right shinbone
is broken at the ankle.

01:02:02.968 --> 01:02:04.470
In short, an open fracture.

01:02:05.263 --> 01:02:07.390
Emergency surgery was done

01:02:07.473 --> 01:02:09.933
to prevent infection at the wound.

01:02:10.476 --> 01:02:14.104
We secured the fracture
with screws and a plate.

01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:19.610
It'll take two months
before it can bear your weight.

01:02:20.278 --> 01:02:21.404
Two months.

01:02:22.195 --> 01:02:23.489
One more thing.

01:02:23.572 --> 01:02:29.244
Surgery couldn't unite
the joint surfaces perfectly.

01:02:29.328 --> 01:02:31.747
There's a risk of osteoarthritis.

01:02:32.665 --> 01:02:34.625
Osteoarthritis?

01:02:35.709 --> 01:02:40.255
You could experience
joint pain and stiffness,

01:02:40.339 --> 01:02:43.342
making it hard to walk or run like before.

01:02:44.552 --> 01:02:47.262
The hairline fracture in your left arm

01:02:47.346 --> 01:02:51.600
may make crutches moot for a while.

01:02:54.102 --> 01:02:55.145
Will I heal?

01:02:57.690 --> 01:03:00.067
It's hard to say at this stage.

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:15.874
Josee.

01:03:17.042 --> 01:03:18.085
I'm sorry.

01:03:21.755 --> 01:03:22.840
It's not your fault.

01:03:25.593 --> 01:03:28.095
I seem to be in pretty bad shape.

01:03:29.137 --> 01:03:31.849
Even rehab might not fix everything.

01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:38.313
If it turns out I can't walk again, I…

01:03:46.405 --> 01:03:47.365
I need to sleep.

01:04:04.423 --> 01:04:05.257
Quiet!

01:04:20.063 --> 01:04:22.149
You don't need to come, Mom.

01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:24.234
You'll hurt your back.

01:04:24.902 --> 01:04:26.779
It's no big deal, I swear.

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:32.535
I'll come visit
after I leave the hospital. See you.

01:04:35.788 --> 01:04:36.622
Professor.

01:04:38.916 --> 01:04:40.709
How are you, Tsuneo?

01:04:41.293 --> 01:04:43.754
I'm sorry to worry you.

01:04:46.799 --> 01:04:49.217
Listen, about your study abroad.

01:04:50.636 --> 01:04:53.096
They'd like another student

01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:55.683
to come in March if you can't.

01:04:57.476 --> 01:05:01.229
It's a pity,
but you'll get another chance.

01:05:01.939 --> 01:05:05.233
For now, just focus on getting well.

01:05:09.988 --> 01:05:10.989
That's not the problem.

01:05:12.825 --> 01:05:16.244
It's possible I may not
be able to dive anymore.

01:05:18.664 --> 01:05:23.460
If I can't do that,
I'll lose my reason for going abroad.

01:05:33.804 --> 01:05:37.349
SPANISH GRAMMAR

01:06:05.168 --> 01:06:07.129
So rotate your ankle

01:06:07.212 --> 01:06:11.466
and extend your toes
to the extent possible.

01:06:12.092 --> 01:06:14.928
When the swelling goes down,

01:06:15.012 --> 01:06:18.682
we can shift to your rehabilitation.

01:06:21.351 --> 01:06:22.185
Tsuneo.

01:06:24.104 --> 01:06:25.230
I bought pudding.

01:06:27.232 --> 01:06:28.108
Thanks.

01:06:30.402 --> 01:06:32.112
Starting rehab already?

01:06:33.321 --> 01:06:34.156
Yeah.

01:06:34.948 --> 01:06:36.742
I'll put this in the fridge.

01:06:38.535 --> 01:06:43.415
My parents keep sending
rice and vegetables.

01:06:43.498 --> 01:06:45.834
My fridge is bulging.

01:06:45.918 --> 01:06:47.670
SPANISH GRAMMAR

01:06:54.009 --> 01:06:56.303
Want to get some fresh air?

01:07:08.941 --> 01:07:11.068
Feel free to say what's on your mind.

01:07:12.402 --> 01:07:14.071
I'm here to give you my support.

01:07:16.865 --> 01:07:21.328
It doesn't matter anymore…
Studying abroad, Mexico.

01:07:23.496 --> 01:07:27.000
I thought I was stronger than this.

01:07:28.376 --> 01:07:30.003
Please don't give up.

01:07:30.087 --> 01:07:31.504
Work hard on rehab--

01:07:31.588 --> 01:07:34.299
"Work hard"? What if it doesn't matter?

01:07:36.802 --> 01:07:39.429
I didn't understand anything.

01:07:40.848 --> 01:07:44.559
How scary it is
to reach for something I want.

01:07:51.274 --> 01:07:53.568
I…

01:07:53.652 --> 01:07:54.569
have feelings for you, Tsuneo!

01:07:55.863 --> 01:07:58.240
I just didn't want that

01:07:58.323 --> 01:08:01.368
to get in the way of your goals.

01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:04.830
But I can't help it.

01:08:06.832 --> 01:08:08.876
I'm madly in love with you!

01:08:15.883 --> 01:08:17.259
How'd this happen?

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:21.138
Mai, listen. I--

01:08:21.221 --> 01:08:22.347
I know.

01:08:23.766 --> 01:08:26.476
I don't need a "Sorry" or a "Thanks."

01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:30.438
I hate women who cry in front of men.

01:08:34.276 --> 01:08:35.193
But…

01:08:37.696 --> 01:08:38.989
I needed to say it.

01:08:48.206 --> 01:08:49.792
We should get back.

01:09:10.478 --> 01:09:12.856
I know you're there! Answer the door!

01:09:17.945 --> 01:09:18.946
If you don't…

01:09:21.031 --> 01:09:21.865
Go away!

01:09:23.992 --> 01:09:24.952
Don't come back.

01:09:27.955 --> 01:09:30.415
Tsuneo's given up on studying abroad.

01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:34.252
So now I'm making him mine.

01:09:35.170 --> 01:09:39.382
I'll give him the love
he needs to forget the sea.

01:09:41.551 --> 01:09:44.262
I never wanted him to go to Mexico.

01:09:45.889 --> 01:09:48.141
I prayed he'd forget his silly dream

01:09:49.267 --> 01:09:53.355
and stay near me.
I wanted to be by his side.

01:09:55.816 --> 01:09:57.776
I know him so much better than you.

01:09:58.819 --> 01:10:03.198
His love for talking about fish,
the awful way he hums.

01:10:04.116 --> 01:10:05.951
He's bad at rock-paper-scissors.

01:10:07.327 --> 01:10:10.580
He likes pudding, hates cucumbers,

01:10:10.663 --> 01:10:13.416
and always has ice-cold hands.

01:10:15.752 --> 01:10:18.546
I could name a hundred more things.

01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:21.341
I know him far better.

01:10:23.844 --> 01:10:25.553
Well, say something!

01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:29.474
My Servant's never giving up.

01:10:30.058 --> 01:10:34.354
He'll never forget
about fish or abandon his dream!

01:10:34.938 --> 01:10:36.106
That's who he is!

01:10:37.065 --> 01:10:38.691
You know that, right?

01:10:40.944 --> 01:10:44.322
I can't name a hundred things about him.

01:10:46.408 --> 01:10:48.952
But you can't beat my feelings for him.

01:10:51.246 --> 01:10:53.540
If that's true, then show it!

01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:10.015
Salty.

01:11:19.524 --> 01:11:20.943
You're clumsy.

01:11:22.527 --> 01:11:24.112
I'm a good woman.

01:11:29.326 --> 01:11:32.996
Why don't you buy me dinner then?

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:33.914
What?

01:12:09.908 --> 01:12:10.742
Josee.

01:12:13.703 --> 01:12:14.829
I have a request.

01:12:26.633 --> 01:12:30.678
You should let the characters
show more emotions.

01:12:31.346 --> 01:12:32.805
Say how they feel.

01:12:33.723 --> 01:12:34.557
I see.

01:13:11.970 --> 01:13:13.013
Hey, redhead.

01:13:14.139 --> 01:13:15.057
Josee?

01:13:16.766 --> 01:13:17.684
Lend me your face.

01:13:18.893 --> 01:13:19.936
What?

01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:23.231
LOST PROFILE

01:13:24.357 --> 01:13:28.736
I desired nothing but my escape from him.

01:13:29.529 --> 01:13:30.655
That is all.

01:13:32.157 --> 01:13:35.952
Upon reflection,
it was truly a pitiful story.

01:13:44.669 --> 01:13:45.545
It's done.

01:13:46.129 --> 01:13:46.963
Ta-da.

01:13:50.717 --> 01:13:51.926
What's this?

01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:54.596
Isn't it obvious? Permission to leave.

01:13:55.597 --> 01:13:57.640
No, why do you have it?

01:13:57.724 --> 01:14:00.060
I just figured you might seek

01:14:00.143 --> 01:14:02.770
a change of pace once in a while.

01:14:05.148 --> 01:14:08.026
I'm sorry, but I'm not in the mood.

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:12.364
Don't be such a bore, Tsuneo.
Let's have some fun!

01:14:12.447 --> 01:14:13.615
Leave me alone!

01:14:19.746 --> 01:14:23.666
As your diving buddy,
it's my job to give you oxygen…

01:14:25.752 --> 01:14:29.589
whenever you need it.
So shut up and follow me.

01:14:36.804 --> 01:14:38.056
What's going on?

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:39.224
Don't ask questions.

01:14:44.187 --> 01:14:45.021
This place.

01:15:03.581 --> 01:15:07.960
THE MERMAID AND THE SHINY WING

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:13.091
The Mermaid and the Shiny Wing.

01:15:22.809 --> 01:15:25.145
From the floor of the deep blue sea,

01:15:25.228 --> 01:15:27.439
festive music is heard.

01:15:28.106 --> 01:15:30.692
It's a mermaid's 20th birthday

01:15:30.775 --> 01:15:34.028
when she can leave the sea.

01:15:38.908 --> 01:15:39.784
You're doing fine.

01:15:46.999 --> 01:15:51.796
The mermaid received
a magic shell as a gift.

01:15:52.922 --> 01:15:54.299
And it spoke to her.

01:15:54.882 --> 01:15:57.885
"You can use me to turn human,

01:15:57.969 --> 01:15:59.804
and back into a mermaid again."

01:16:00.972 --> 01:16:04.642
"But you must not wish for anything else."

01:16:05.310 --> 01:16:07.145
"For if you do,

01:16:08.646 --> 01:16:11.233
you'll turn to froth and vanish forever."

01:16:12.817 --> 01:16:16.654
"I understand,"
said the mermaid and swam ashore.

01:16:18.030 --> 01:16:21.201
"Oh, shell, turn me into a human."

01:16:23.161 --> 01:16:26.414
Suddenly, her fins became graceful legs.

01:16:27.415 --> 01:16:31.419
"How wonderful,"
she exclaimed as she climbed a hill.

01:16:32.504 --> 01:16:35.590
But the world outside was full of danger.

01:16:37.175 --> 01:16:40.428
A ferocious tiger appeared before her.

01:16:42.054 --> 01:16:44.098
The mermaid tried to run

01:16:45.016 --> 01:16:47.269
but lost her footing and fell.

01:16:48.353 --> 01:16:52.607
Clinging to a rock, she yelled, "Help!"

01:16:54.317 --> 01:16:58.154
Just then, a young man
with pure white wings

01:16:58.238 --> 01:17:00.948
descended from the sky to help.

01:17:01.949 --> 01:17:04.160
"Thank you. Those are lovely wings."

01:17:05.077 --> 01:17:08.290
The young man
beamed happily at those words.

01:17:09.499 --> 01:17:12.835
"When spring comes,
I'm taking flight with them."

01:17:13.878 --> 01:17:15.963
For he had a dream.

01:17:17.924 --> 01:17:22.470
It was to fly
to a shiny sea far, far away.

01:17:23.388 --> 01:17:27.099
A place where a family
of bright orange fish swam.

01:17:27.850 --> 01:17:29.977
A vast sea, full of fun and frolic.

01:17:31.479 --> 01:17:35.525
The two became friends
and went to many places together.

01:17:36.901 --> 01:17:40.447
"Every place makes my heart
dance with such joy,

01:17:40.530 --> 01:17:42.114
I feel like skipping."

01:17:43.115 --> 01:17:46.411
The mermaid saw her world grow and expand.

01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:50.457
The seasons changed and spring arrived.

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:55.169
The day for
the young man's departure came.

01:17:55.878 --> 01:18:00.675
The mermaid was sad
and walked alone in the woods.

01:18:01.551 --> 01:18:05.805
Again, a ferocious tiger
appeared before her.

01:18:06.764 --> 01:18:10.393
Claws sharp, fangs bared,
it pounced on the mermaid.

01:18:10.977 --> 01:18:13.313
"Look out," cried the young man,

01:18:13.396 --> 01:18:16.107
appearing just in time to save her.

01:18:16.983 --> 01:18:19.819
But this time, he was injured,

01:18:20.445 --> 01:18:22.989
his gorgeous wings, broken.

01:18:24.532 --> 01:18:26.576
Sobbing with grief,

01:18:27.076 --> 01:18:30.580
the mermaid took
the magic shell in her hands

01:18:31.914 --> 01:18:34.667
and wished, "Please save him."

01:18:36.461 --> 01:18:39.381
Within seconds, his wounds healed

01:18:39.922 --> 01:18:41.674
and the youth awoke alive and well,

01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:45.803
but his wings would never return.

01:18:46.971 --> 01:18:52.602
"I can no longer reach
the shiny sea," he lamented.

01:18:53.311 --> 01:18:54.979
The mermaid said, "Raise your head."

01:18:56.022 --> 01:18:59.484
"You have larger wings in your heart."

01:19:00.902 --> 01:19:03.405
"With those wings, you sheltered me

01:19:04.238 --> 01:19:06.866
and used them to push me forward."

01:19:07.742 --> 01:19:11.871
"With wings of the heart,
you can fly anywhere."

01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:17.043
The young man set off
for the shiny sea by boat.

01:19:18.210 --> 01:19:20.797
In driving rain or stormy winds,

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:22.965
he pushed ever forward.

01:19:23.758 --> 01:19:27.720
"I'm not afraid
for I'm in pursuit of my dreams."

01:19:28.721 --> 01:19:34.477
His heart wings were
strong, supple, and beautiful.

01:19:34.561 --> 01:19:36.354
And most of all, unbreakable.

01:19:37.522 --> 01:19:39.941
At last, he found the shiny sea.

01:19:41.233 --> 01:19:43.903
With great joy, he dove into it.

01:19:43.986 --> 01:19:48.282
He started swimming freely
with the orange fish,

01:19:49.534 --> 01:19:52.662
so happy that his dream came true.

01:19:54.121 --> 01:19:58.125
"Oh, shell, you can now
turn me into bubbles."

01:19:59.919 --> 01:20:03.631
But her legs turned back into fins

01:20:03.715 --> 01:20:06.258
and nothing else occurred.

01:20:07.635 --> 01:20:09.220
The magic shell spoke.

01:20:10.262 --> 01:20:11.556
"Wishing for another's benefit

01:20:12.098 --> 01:20:16.310
and not your own
will never make you vanish."

01:20:19.439 --> 01:20:24.026
So with a heart filled
with shiny jewels of memories,

01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:27.405
the mermaid returned to the deep blue sea.

01:20:28.948 --> 01:20:29.782
The end.

01:22:17.765 --> 01:22:19.058
Why are you hiding?

01:22:26.941 --> 01:22:28.400
Look, I think he can make it!

01:22:44.792 --> 01:22:46.836
-You did it!
-You did it!

01:22:58.598 --> 01:23:01.225
Yukichi, My Servant walked today.

01:23:04.854 --> 01:23:06.898
Stray cats must not get spoiled.

01:23:14.989 --> 01:23:16.240
Must not get spoiled.

01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:20.745
Fight the tiger yourself.

01:23:24.791 --> 01:23:25.875
I'm getting out!

01:23:27.585 --> 01:23:30.630
I just need to make weekly visits.

01:23:31.422 --> 01:23:35.134
That's great. Congrats!

01:23:36.552 --> 01:23:37.386
Thanks.

01:23:40.097 --> 01:23:42.433
I'm not sure about the side effects yet,

01:23:43.643 --> 01:23:46.478
but I'm going to Mexico no matter what.

01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:50.566
Now that I've got heart wings.

01:23:55.112 --> 01:23:56.572
You'll be fine.

01:24:00.242 --> 01:24:03.245
They're letting me leave on the 24th.

01:24:04.413 --> 01:24:06.791
Can you come get me?

01:24:07.374 --> 01:24:08.334
10 a.m.

01:24:13.214 --> 01:24:14.048
Josee?

01:24:17.009 --> 01:24:19.095
I'm just so happy.

01:24:21.055 --> 01:24:21.889
Thank you.

01:25:47.141 --> 01:25:47.975
Josee?

01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:03.950
Josee!

01:26:27.306 --> 01:26:28.140
Josee.

01:26:29.851 --> 01:26:30.684
Here.

01:26:35.857 --> 01:26:36.690
Ms. Kana!

01:26:37.191 --> 01:26:39.861
Tsuneo, congrats on getting out.

01:26:40.694 --> 01:26:41.653
Where's Josee?

01:26:41.737 --> 01:26:43.364
I haven't seen her today.

01:26:45.616 --> 01:26:46.450
Sorry.

01:26:47.701 --> 01:26:49.161
You're so right.

01:26:51.205 --> 01:26:53.124
Big trouble! Josee's missing!

01:27:20.943 --> 01:27:23.863
A girl in a wheelchair just boarded.

01:27:25.447 --> 01:27:27.408
Do you know where to?

01:28:24.423 --> 01:28:26.383
Attention, guests.

01:28:27.759 --> 01:28:30.471
The zoo will be closing in a few minutes.

01:28:31.388 --> 01:28:37.311
Please make sure you have
all your belongings with you.

01:29:36.412 --> 01:29:37.288
Josee.

01:29:53.971 --> 01:29:54.805
Stop!

01:29:57.099 --> 01:29:57.933
Sorry!

01:30:15.784 --> 01:30:16.868
Josee!

01:30:30.799 --> 01:30:31.883
That hurts.

01:30:34.678 --> 01:30:36.972
You all right, Josee?

01:30:38.182 --> 01:30:39.766
Are you okay yourself?

01:30:43.895 --> 01:30:44.730
Your leg.

01:30:45.647 --> 01:30:47.274
You just got out.

01:30:48.942 --> 01:30:52.821
In my panic to find you,
I found myself running.

01:30:54.156 --> 01:30:54.990
Why?

01:31:00.371 --> 01:31:02.748
I've decided to try to become

01:31:02.831 --> 01:31:04.750
a picture book illustrator.

01:31:05.959 --> 01:31:07.794
I plan to stand on my own two feet.

01:31:10.089 --> 01:31:14.551
You've pushed me
from behind for long enough.

01:31:14.635 --> 01:31:15.677
It's not for you.

01:31:18.222 --> 01:31:19.556
It wasn't for you.

01:31:21.308 --> 01:31:23.144
I want to be Your Servant.

01:31:26.230 --> 01:31:28.440
What about the clarion angel?

01:31:29.024 --> 01:31:30.984
And going to Mexico?

01:31:31.527 --> 01:31:33.529
I'll still go, but…

01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:36.073
I love you, Josee!

01:31:45.207 --> 01:31:46.041
I…

01:31:48.127 --> 01:31:48.960
I…

01:31:52.589 --> 01:31:54.133
love you too, My Servant.

01:32:22.244 --> 01:32:24.288
It's not at all like I imagined.

01:32:25.914 --> 01:32:28.292
What? In a bad way?

01:32:30.836 --> 01:32:32.129
In a good way.

01:37:23.044 --> 01:37:24.630
-Pretty, right?
-Yes.

01:37:29.426 --> 01:37:31.136
It's really a cherry blossom rain.

01:37:37.601 --> 01:37:38.977
Did you die?

01:37:39.645 --> 01:37:40.521
What?

01:37:40.604 --> 01:37:41.897
Are you a ghost?

01:37:42.606 --> 01:37:44.399
I'm home for spring break.

01:37:44.483 --> 01:37:45.567
You didn't tell me!

01:37:46.485 --> 01:37:48.654
I wanted to surprise you.

01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:53.950
Pretty cocky for a servant.
