<b>TOHO CORPORATION</b>

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.590
Some mornings, I wake up crying
without knowing why.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.940
That's when everything happens
now and again.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.020
Whatever that dream was I had,
I can never remember it.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.030
- But...
- But...

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.670
the only thing that
does last when I wake up

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.690
is a sense of loss,

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.690
which lingers for a long time afterwards.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.180
I'm always searching for something

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.200
or someone.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.590
I've been consumed by this feeling...

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.590
ever since that day.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.390
The day... a star fell.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.940
It was almost like...

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.950
like seeing something out of a dream.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.940
Nothing more or less...

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.120
- than a breathtaking view.
- than a breathtaking view.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.910
Ah, if only our voices speak at night

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.580
could ever reach the very
edge of this world

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.110
and of time

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.270
instead of fading into air and dust.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.320
Then what will the words, could it ever be

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.030
farthest words from "probably"?

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.530
Let's make a promise that will never fade.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.330
Let's say it together on
the count of three, oh.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.450
Ah, I'm told that some part of
every wish will be heard,

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.220
but lately I've lost sight of
the truth in those words.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.470
I can't even remember when
I gave up believing.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.040
What could have been the reason?

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.360
Ah, the very moment that the rain will stop

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.900
in the place rainbow born and dies.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.840
And where the end of this life lies,

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.530
I've always been insisting there was
something that I've longing for.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.480
One day we'll reach to emotions
unexplored, unprecedented.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.210
We'll high-five love we've yet to
discover and give a kiss to time.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.870
The five dimensions keeps on teasing me,

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.930
but I will keep on looking at you, dear.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.280
Let's make a sign for when we
say "nice to meet you" again.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.150
I'm on my way to you,

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.120
chasing after your name.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.630
Taki...

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.380
Taki.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.420
Taki!

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.790
Don't you remember?

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.830
My name is...

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:58.850
Mitsuha!

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.530
Sis, what are you... doing?

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.910
Whoa, they're so realistic-feeling...

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.611
"Sis"?

00:04:42.631 --> 00:04:43.720
Me?

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.380
Are you still asleep?

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.530
Breakfast time, hurry up!

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.550
Huh?

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:10.940
Wha-?

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.780
WHAAAT?!

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.000
Do you wanna have any of
last night's fish, grandma?

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.720
You can eat it.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.720
- Mornin'!
- Mornin'!

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.840
Lazy butt, you're so slow!

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.070
I'll fix breakfast tomorrow.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.000
Oh, that's a lot...

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.360
Oh, well.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.570
- You're back to normal today.
- Huh?

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.280
- You were so crazy yesterday.
- What do you mean, "crazy"?

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.890
Attention, citizens of Itomori.

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.160
Good morning!

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.910
This is an official announcement
from Itomori Town Hall.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.840
It is in regards to the mayoral election.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.920
The election will be held
on the 20th of next month.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.770
The election committee would
like to remind everyone tha-

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:06.230
"Comet to pass by in a month:
Visible to the naked eye"

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.550
A comet that comes only
once every 1,200 years

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.280
will finally be headed our way in a month.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.630
The comet will be visible to the naked eye for
several days once it approaches the Earth...

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.780
Just make up with him already, okay?

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.950
- That's an adult matter.
- According to JAXA's spokesperson, they're preparing for the celestial show of the millennium.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.580
"Position of Comet Tiamat"

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.600
"Closest on October 4th"

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.650
- We're leaving!
- We're leaving!

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:50.090
I can't wait 'til the festival!
It's gonna be so much fun!

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.110
Study hard, sis!

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.400
Ah!

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:11.940
Mitsuha!

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.890
Good mornin', Saya! Mornin', Teshi!

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.560
- Mornin'!
- Come on, would you get off already?

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.680
- What for, meanie?
- 'Cause you're heavy.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.880
- Hey, that's rude!
- Y'know, I gotta say. You two make a great couple.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.590
- No, we don't!
- No, we don't!

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.450
Oh, I see you actually
bothered to do your hair today.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:32.300
- Wait, what?
- Oh, yeah. What happened? Did your grandma exorcise all your demons?

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.720
- Exorcise?
- Somethin' totally possessed your body!

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.710
Would you just give it a rest
with all this occult nonsense?

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:43.180
- Mitsuha's gotta be feelin' stressed enough as it is, right?
- What are you guys talking about?

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.200
Are you feelin' okay?

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:53.230
And above all, restoring the town's fiscal health
so we can continue our revitalization project.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:59.150
It's only when all these things are achieved
that we can create a safe and secure community.

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:04.420
- As the incumbent, my administration...
- Miyamizu's gonna get another term anyway.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.790
I hear he's been dullin' out the pork.
Just between us.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.970
- Hey, Miyamizu.
- Mornin'.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:15.180
Looks like the mayor and the
contractor's kid are pretty cozy, too.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.340
To improve the quality of
life of each and every resident.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.090
Mitsuha!

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.690
Stand up straight when you're walking!

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.040
Oh, he's tough on his family.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.500
Well, that's the mayor for ya.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.970
- Awkward.
- Sucks to be her.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:33.690
Mitsuha!

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:39.460
"Who are you?"

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.030
In front of everyone.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:49.980
"Tasokare" [Twilight]

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.540
"Two light." That's the
origin of the word twilight.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.300
I'm sure everyone here knows that word.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.770
It's dusk, a time when
it's neither day nor night.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:02.220
When the border between worlds blur,

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.220
and one might encounter
something not human.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.880
Another older term for it is dusk light.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.041
Some people also call it "golden hour".

00:09:13.061 --> 00:09:13.071
"Karetaso/Kawatare = Who is that?"

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.900
-What about "magic hour"?
It's something my grandma says.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.670
Well, golden hour and magic
hour are technically the same,

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:22.390
but it's a term that
mostly photographers use.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:22.830
"Who are you?"

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.330
Well, she does take a lot of pictures.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.510
Okay, next...

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:31.860
- Miyamizu!
- Uh, yes?

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.230
Well, I can see that you
remember your own name today.

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:41.190
- You... don't remember?
- Uh-uh...

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:45.420
Well, believe it or not, you forgot where
your own desk and locker were yesterday.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.540
Plus, you had the worst case of bedhead,
and you didn't have your ribbon on, either!

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.080
What?! No way!

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.730
Yeah, it was like you
had amnesia or somethin'.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:01.380
Now that you mention it, I do feel like
I've been havin' weird dreams lately.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.420
Like a dream about someone else's life?

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.660
It's all so fuzzy.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.200
Wait a sec, I've got it...

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.960
It's memories from a previous life,

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:15.790
or maybe your subconscious linked to the
Everett interpretation of the multiverse!

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:17.110
Keep your full mouth shut!

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.950
Wait a minute! Teshi, don't tell me you
were the one who wrote in my noteboo... k.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.070
Forget it.

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:29.060
But you really were actin' just a
little funny yesterday, Mitsuha.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.290
You been feelin' okay?

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:35.010
That's what's weird. I feel fine.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:39.140
Maybe it's from stress. You know, you've
got that ritual comin' up soon, don'tcha?

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.340
Ugh, don't remind me!

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.920
I can't stand this place anymore!
It's too small and town-ey.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:50.430
I wanna graduate already and
go to Tokyo as soon as I can!

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:55.690
Can't say I blame you. There really
is nothin' at all in this town.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:01.200
There's only one train that stops here every two
hours -and all the stores close at nine o' clock.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.030
No bookstores, no dentists,

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:03.310
"Mother's" "Cat's Eye Pub"

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.680
but two cocktail lounges
for whatever reason.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.160
- No jobs in town.
- No one date-able.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.790
Even the days are too short.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.010
You know what?!

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:14.720
- No, what?
- No, what?

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:18.050
Forget that stuff.
Why don't we go to a café?

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:19.510
- A café?
- Really?

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:20.830
- Where?!
- Where?!

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:26.351
Hello, kids!

00:11:26.371 --> 00:11:27.730
- Hi, there!
- Evenin', ma'am!

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:36.310
- How is this a café?
- Like this town's got a café.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.250
Mitsuha just went straight home.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:45.030
- Things have gotta be really rough for her right now.
- She's on center stage and all.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:46.050
Yeah...

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.010
- Hey, Teshi...
- Hm?

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:55.450
What are you gonna do after
you graduate high school?

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:58.430
Where'd that come from?
You talkin' about the future?

00:11:58.450 --> 00:11:59.940
Mh-hm.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:05.520
I dunno. I think I'll probably just end up
livin' in this town, y'know. Same as ever.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.490
I wanna do what you're doin'.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:26.400
It's still too soon for you to
try, Yotsuha.

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.930
Listen to the thread's voice.

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:35.450
When you twine it round and round like this, feelings
will start flowing between you and the thread.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.500
- It's not like threads talk...
- She's telling you to focus.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:46.130
Etched within our braided cords is a
thousand years' worth of Itomori's history.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:50.180
Listen. Somethin' happened
two hundred years ago...

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.600
Here she goes.

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:58.750
The bathroom of sandal maker Mayugoro Yamazaki
caught on fire and this whole area burned down.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:02.230
The shrine and old
documents were destroyed.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.650
- This is known as...
- Mayugoro's Great Fire.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:10.180
They named the fire after him?!
I feel bad for Mayugoro.

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:14.710
The meaning behind our festivals
was lost because of that.

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:17.300
Only the surface was left.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:21.600
But even if those words are
gone, those words shouldn't fade.

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:26.110
That's the Miyamizu shrine's duty.
Our important task.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.390
Ugh...

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:32.220
Despite all that, that son-in-law of mine!

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:37.920
Abandoning the Shinto priesthood and leaving
this house were bad enough, but politics?!

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:40.590
Oh, he's hopeless!

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.120
Have another, mister foreman.

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:49.950
- I'll be counting on your help again for this election.
- Leave it to me.

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:53.880
You'll get the votes from the
Kadoiri and Sakagami Districts, guaranteed.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:57.540
- How's the datin' scene?
- It ain't easy, that's for sure.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:03.100
- Smells like corruption in there.
- What are you talkin' about?

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:06.840
- We're gonna need two or three more bottles.
- Yes, dear.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.870
Katsuhiko, you're gonna help
out at the site this weekend.

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:13.090
- We'll be usin' explosives, so you better study up.
- Grngh.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:14.150
What was that?!

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.170
Got it!

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:31.520
Guess we both can't stand things here.

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:52.750
Is that Yotsuha? She's all grown up.

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.490
They're lookers, alright.
Just like their mother.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.110
- Heya!
- Hey.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.270
World's oldest kind of sake,

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:40.230
but chewin' on rice, spittin' it out, and then
lettin' it ferment naturally, it becomes alcohol.

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:42.260
Kuchikamizake.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:45.300
Do the gods really appreciate that.
The way it's ma-

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.510
Yeah, of course they do!

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.610
Hey, check it out. It's Miyamizu.

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:03.630
- Ugh! I'd never do that!
- And in front of everybody! Embarrassing, right?

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.470
You should try to cheer up, sis.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.590
Who cares if a few of the kids
from your school saw that?

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:25.540
It must be nice for you
not being a teenager.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:30.580
Hey, I know! You should just sell
Kuchikamizake and move to Tokyo!

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:35.440
I bet you could sell it with all sorts of
stuff like photos and making-of videos.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:41.470
Oh, and then you can call it "Shrine
Maiden's Sake"! You'll make buttloads!

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:43.490
"Shrine Maiden's Sake"

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.860
I can't! There are liquor laws!

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.070
That's what you have a problem with?

00:16:56.030 --> 00:17:00.900
I hate this town! I hate this life, too!

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:08.290
Please make me a handsome
Tokyo boy in my next life!

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.380
What a jackass.

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:41.430
Ow...

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.090
Where...?

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:56.870
Huh?

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:04.450
Hmm?

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:08.630
Something's... there...

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:14.650
Aaaah!

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:23.420
Eh!

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:25.450
Taki, you up?

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:31.390
It was your turn to cook breakfast,
wasn't it? Did you sleep in?

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.300
I'm sorry.

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:35.630
Ugh, I'm heading out.

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:38.700
- Finish the miso.
- Uh, okay...

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.260
Make sure you go to school,
even if you're late. Seeya.

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.170
H-have a nice day.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.480
What a strange dream...

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:02.010
"From Tsukasa: Run, you're late!"

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.700
Huh? It's from "Tsukasa"?

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.610
Who's that? Hrm.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.780
Uhhh...

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.280
I gotta go pee.

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:30.050
Way too real...

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:21.770
"Shinjuku Station"

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:43.380
I'm in Tokyo!

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:49.320
"Jingu High School"

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:51.450
- Where did you get this?
- Daikanyama.

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:52.970
Guess who's opening at our next gig?

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:56.810
- W-wait wait, we have a gig?
- Hey, let's skip club stuff today and catch a movie.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:00.480
Uh...

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.340
Taaaki!

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:07.290
Can't believe you got in at noon.
Come on, let's grab lunch!

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.860
You ignored my text, too!

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:15.010
- Mr. Tsukasa.
- "Mister"? You don't have to go that far.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.500
- You got lost?
- Yeah.

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:22.640
Wait a second. How'd you wind up
getting lost on the way to school?

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:23.720
Uh...

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.510
Well, a girl... A girl?

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:27.480
A gal-

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:28.210
- Hm?
- Hm?

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:29.110
I mean...

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:30.001
- Huh?!
- Huh?!

00:21:30.021 --> 00:21:31.021
A guy...

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:39.450
Y'know, guys just wanna have fun. Every day's a
festival when you're living in Tokyo... as a guy.

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:41.790
Hey, you... sound funny.

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:43.880
And where's your lunch?

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.570
- Seriously?
- What is up with you?

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:50.010
- We could share somethin'.
- Let's make a croquette-egg sandwich.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.950
Yes! Hahahaha!

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:54.350
Ah...

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:56.050
Thank you!

00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:00.810
- Wanna hit the café later?
- Oh, that one? Sure.

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:01.621
You in, Taki?

00:22:01.641 --> 00:22:04.700
What? What?! WHAT?!

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.000
A café?!

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:13.220
- They've got nice timberwork in here.
- Yeah, it's pretty intricate.

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:15.340
Taki, all set?

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.250
Uh...

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:20.500
I could live for a whole month
on what these pancakes cost!

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:23.520
Uh... maybe a decade ago.

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:25.470
Hmmm...

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:28.020
Oh, well! It's only a dream!

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:36.520
Dreams are great!

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.660
Huh?

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.610
Wha? Oh no! I think that I'm late for work.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.880
- You got a shift today?
- Guess you better get goin'.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.100
Right.

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:53.330
Sorry, but uh...

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:56.090
Where exactly do I work?

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:57.550
- Wha?
- Wha?

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:08.060
- Tables six, seven, and ten are waiting!
- Table twelve! Taki!

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.140
Got it!

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:10.650
Here you go.

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:13.900
So, the zucchini and tomato
salad with a side of...

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.220
- We didn't order that!
- Wha?

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:19.950
- Taki! I told you that we are out of truffles!
- Taki, you gotta talk louder!

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:21.150
Taki!

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.590
When is this nightmare gonna be over?!

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:34.150
Waiter.

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:37.730
- Hey, you.
- Uh, yes?

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:42.070
See this? Does it look right?
A toothpick's in it.

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:45.070
What would have happened if we ate it?

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.020
It's really lucky I noticed when I did.

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:52.440
- Do something.
- Uh... it's just that...

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:56.400
Well, I don't even think
we have toothpicks at this-

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:58.450
What?!

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:02.080
Excuse me. Is everything alright over here?

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:05.410
- Well, like I was trying to tell the guy...
- I'll take care of this.

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:08.070
What's wrong with you today?

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:12.320
We truly apologize.
Your meal is on the house tonight.

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:13.490
Why, thank you.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:16.140
You weren't hurt, were you?

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:30.360
- Uh... Oku... dera?
- That's "Miss" to you.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:34.370
-Miss Okudera. About before-
-We just had some bad luck is all.

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:37.900
-No, I-I-
-Those guys were definitely scamming us.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.990
I handled it according to the
manual, but still...

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.230
Uh-Ms. Okudera, your skirt!

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.640
- Are you alright?
- Did something happen?

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.560
Looks like someone cut it.

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:51.570
That guy...

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.570
- Do you remember what he looked like?
- No...

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:58.410
- Come with me.
- Hey, Taki.

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:00.370
Okay, take off your skirt.

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:01.231
What?!

00:25:01.251 --> 00:25:03.020
N- wh-I'll... I'll look the other way!

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:09.510
Hold on, this won't take long.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:16.180
All done! Ta-da!

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:20.170
You're really good, Taki!
It's way cuter now!

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:26.280
By the way, I wanted to thank you for
all your help with that customer earlier.

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:30.640
To be honest, well...
I was worried about you.

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:34.640
You aren't that strong,
but you're quick to pick a fight.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:36.700
I like you better today.

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:40.380
You've got a feminine side.
Who woulda guessed?

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:43.620
"JR Yamanote Line: 7 min."

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:54.880
I gotta say,
this dream sure does seem real.

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:01.740
Ah, looks like he keeps a journal.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.660
So organized.

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:11.160
I wish I lived in Tokyo.

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.340
One of her.

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:23.500
Unrequited love?

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:34.210
"Walked to the station with Ms. Okudera
after work, thanks to my feminine powers!"

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:37.050
"Who are you?"

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:50.460
"Mitsuha"

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:06.590
"Mitsuha"

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:09.050
What is this?

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:13.460
Wha?!

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.570
What?!

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:14.950
"Thanks to my feminine powers!"

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:16.870
What is going on?!

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:19.810
So, café today?

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:22.180
Thanks, but I gotta go to work.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.350
Ha, do you remember where to go?

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:26.330
Huh?...Ah!

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:30.410
Wait a second. Was that you, Tsukasa? Are you
the one that's been messing with my phone?

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:33.040
Uh... Never mind.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.770
Later.

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:37.380
Well, he's back to normal.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.100
I think he was kinda... cute yesterday.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.100
Uhhhhh...

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:45.820
Uh... what's up?

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.140
Don't play dumb. What about bro code, huh?!

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:51.100
Yeah, you walked home
with her yesterday, right?

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:55.290
Uh, what are you talking about?
Me and Ms. Okudera?

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:56.970
- So what did you guys do?!
- So what did you guys do?! - So what did you guys do?!

00:27:56.990 --> 00:28:00.290
Uh, well... I don't remember, actually.

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:02.270
Quit messin' around and tell us!

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:05.220
Okudera, reporting for duty!

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:11.060
- Don't slack off today, you guys. We're gonna have a good day today.
- Yeah...

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.460
Aren't we, Taki?

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:22.560
Hmmm?

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:26.080
"Mitsuha? Who are you?? What are you??"

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:29.560
I see you're not touching
your boobies today.

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:32.660
Breakfast time! Hurry up!

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.730
MY BOOBS?!

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:41.320
Mornin'!

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:49.900
I feel like everyone's
starin' at me for some reason.

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:54.360
- Well you did kinda make a scene yesterday.
- Uh?!

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:56.341
"Still-life drawing"

00:28:56.361 --> 00:28:57.980
Did you see all the election posters?

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.150
Doesn't matter who wins, nothin'll
change, 'cept for who gets the kickback.

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:05.700
Shhh! Somebody's daddy's dependent on it.

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:07.750
They're talking about me, right?

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:10.150
Uh...

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:12.430
Wait, Mitsuha?!

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.710
I... I...

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.910
I did what?!

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:30.910
Mitsuha?

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:37.530
"What is this life?"

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:40.400
Could this... could this mean-

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:44.720
-No, no, no, no! Could this mean...
that we're really-

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:48.070
That we're...
in our dreams, that guy and I-

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:50.650
That we're...
in our dreams, that girl and I-

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:51.960
- "Life in Tokyo" - "What is this life?"

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:54.060
- We're switching places?!
- We're switching places?!

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:12.810
At last, hello, you've opened your eyes,

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:18.360
but why won't you even look me in the eyes,
what's wrong with you?

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:22.920
You angrily tell me that I'm late.

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:27.660
Well, I'm sorry, but I did my best
and running at my fastest pace!

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.430
I'm slowly beginning to
realize what's going on.

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:33.900
Taki's in high school and living in Tokyo.

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:40.180
Two or three times a week, I'll suddenly and randomly
switch with Mitsuha, who's somewhere out in the boonies.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.170
The trigger is sleep. The cause is unknown.

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:43.690
"Condition: Sleep? Cause: Unknown"

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:49.070
Any memories I have of the switch
get more and more hazy after I wake up.

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:52.130
But there's no doubt that
we're switching places.

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:54.830
The reactions of everyone
around us prove it.

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:56.300
And that's why...

00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:01.410
That's why we decided to lay out some ground rules
so we could protect each other's way of life.

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440
Things to watch out for during the switches,
and a list of stuff we should never do.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:00.740
"Strictly forbidden!"

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.830
"No baths! No looking! No touching!"

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:06.716
"Don't waste money!
No dialect! Don't be late!"

00:31:06.736 --> 00:31:10.840
We also agreed to leave each other reports
on our phones on the days we switch places...

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:15.260
So that we can work together to get
through this... weird thing that's happening.

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:17.270
And yet...

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:18.730
And yet...

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:21.200
- I cannot believe this guy!
- I cannot believe this girl!

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.780
Back in the Zenzenzense 'til this day,

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.780
been looking everywhere for you.

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.270
I followed the sound of
your innocent laughter,

00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:31.370
and it guided me in the right way.

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:33.890
Even if every piece of you disappeared

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:36.130
and if it scattered everywhere...

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:38.790
Guys will stare. Watch the skirt!

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:39.300
These are basics for a girl!

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:40.650
"Careful with skirts!"

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:48.831
Stop wasting my money on sweets! It's goin' in
your body. Plus, I also worked for that money.

00:31:48.851 --> 00:31:49.090
"Braided Cords..."

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:50.750
Braiding cords is impossible!

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:54.340
- You work way too many shifts!
- 'Cause you keep wasting money!

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:58.890
I wonder if we can push our way through

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:04.600
the countless barrier that's waiting
in the future just beyond our view.

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:09.110
Side-by-side, no way we can lose.

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:14.230
We'll beat destiny at its own game
and make it follow our own rules.

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:19.390
Had tea with Ms. Okudera on the
way home. You two have a good thing going!

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:22.900
Quit messing with my
relationships, Mitsuha!

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:26.540
Hey, Taki... why is a girl
confessing her love to me?

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:29.040
Maybe you're just more
popular when I'm you.

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:29.630
-You're so full of yourself!
Like you have a girlfriend!

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:32.070
"Don't be so full of yourself!!"

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.660
It's not like you have anyone, either!

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.410
- I don't...
- I don't...

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:35.440
- Because I don't want a relationship!
- Because I don't want a relationship!

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:37.221
"Dummy" - "Idiot"

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:01.920
I shouldn't for her sake.

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.420
You sure do like your own boobies.

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:11.670
Time to go! Get ready!

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:19.501
Over the course of the last few days, the Tiamat comet
has been visible, but when and where can people see it?

00:33:19.521 --> 00:33:19.620
"Comet Tiamat to Reach Perigee"

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:26.690
The Tiamat comet will be moving in the same direction
the sun does: from East to West from our point of view.

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:30.020
Why are you wearin' your uniform?

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:43.070
Grandma, why does our shrine god's
relic have to be kept so far away?

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:46.530
'Cause of Mayugoro, I don't really know.

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:50.140
- Who's Mayugoro?
- What? He's famous!

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:00.060
Hop on, grandma.

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:06.500
- Oh!
- Watch out! Careful!

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:21.770
Mitsuha. Yotsuha. Do you know about Musubi?

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:22.900
Mu... subi?

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:28.760
It's what we used to call the local guardian
deity long ago, and it means "union".

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:32.000
This word has profound meaning.

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:40.020
Tying strings together is a union, connecting to
people is a union, and the flow of time is a union.

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:47.410
These are all part of the god's power. The
braided cords that we make are tied to that.

00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:52.990
A skill from the god,
they represent the flow of time itself.

00:34:53.690 --> 00:35:01.650
They assemble and take shape. They twist,
tangle, unravel now and then, break...

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:03.780
and reconnect.

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:07.970
That's what a union is. What time is.

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.810
- Have a drink.
- Thanks.

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:18.830
- I want some, too!
- That's also a union.

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:26.020
Whether it's water, rice or sake, when something
becomes a part of a person, it's a union.

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:32.670
It joins their soul, which is why the offering
we're making today is such an important custom.

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:36.080
It connects the god with people.

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:39.840
Hey, I can see it!

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:48.710
This is where it is.
The sacred relic of Miyamizu Shrine.

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:10.220
What lies ahead is the hereafter.
It's the netherworld.

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:14.090
The netherworld!

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:22.900
In order to return to this world, you have to
leave behind what is most important to you.

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:28.110
Like the kuchikamizake.

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:29.940
Kuchikamizake?

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:36.900
You'll offer it at the foot of the shrine
god's relic. After all, it is half of you.

00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:41.410
Half... of Mitsuha.

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:01.750
Wow, it's already magic hour!

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:03.750
Magic hour?

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:19.470
- Oh, yeah! Maybe I can see the comet!
- Huh? The comet?

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:23.210
Oh, Mitsuha...

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:26.730
you're dreaming right now, aren't you?

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:40.690
I'm crying? But why?

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:42.730
Ms. Okudera? She's almost where?

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:45.250
"I'm almost there. Looking forward to it!"

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:53.900
Oh, Mitsuha. What did you do?

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:55.220
Date?!

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:06.050
"Tomorrow's your Tokyo date with Ms.
Okudera."

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:08.840
"Meet up at the station at 10:30!"

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:13.770
Well, that's what I had planned, but...

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:29.540
- Hi, Taki.
- Huh? Agh!

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:35.370
- Wait long?
- Yeah. Aah-no! Uh...

00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:47.860
- I just got here.
- Thank goodness. Let's go!

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:53.840
Must be nice.
They've probably met up about now.

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:59.630
Huh?

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:04.490
Why am I...?

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:06.820
Why...?

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:19.450
"It was a date I wanted to go on, but if it so happens that
you end up goin', you better be grateful and enjoy it!"

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:26.116
This is nice! It's my first time here.
So, is this one of your usual go-to spots?

00:39:26.136 --> 00:39:27.510
"At any rate, I bet you've
never even been on a single date."

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:30.030
No way, it's too expensive!

00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:32.970
I don't know what to say to her.

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:37.640
"That's why I've handpicked some links
below to help you out, ya wallflower!"

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:38.700
For real?

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:40.610
"You, too, can get a girlfriend!"

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:45.590
"Despite social anxiety, I got a girl!"
"The dos and don'ts of texting!"

00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:48.120
She's making fun of me!

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:52.150
"Photo Exhibition: Nostalgia"

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:18.720
You know something, Taki?

00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:23.990
Today, you're...
you're like a different person.

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:37.570
Ms. Okudera. You getting hungry?
We could get dinner.

00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:43.390
- Uh... let's call it a day.
- U-uh... Alright.

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:48.230
- I could be wrong, and I'm sorry if I am...
- About?

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:52.170
But you used to have a
little crush on me, am I right?

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:56.830
But right now,
there's someone else you like, huh?

00:40:56.890 --> 00:41:01.510
- N-n-no! U-uh-it's not that...
- Really?

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:05.960
- There's no one. It's not like that.
- Are you sure about that?

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:10.810
Well, thanks for today. See you at work!

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:27.500
By the time the date's over,

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:31.640
- you should be able to see the comet in the sky.
- "...you should be able to see the comet in the sky."

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:37.480
What does she mean? Weirdo.

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:05.880
Oh.

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:07.590
It's you, Teshi.

00:42:08.050 --> 00:42:12.290
No. I just didn't feel like
goin', that's all. I'm fine.

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:16.360
What? The festival?

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:18.190
Ah...

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:23.020
Oh yeah, the comet.
It'll be at its brightest today, right?

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:26.260
Okay, got it. Seeya later!

00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:33.360
You're just looking forward to seeing
Mitsuha in a yukata, aren'tcha?

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:35.100
I- I am not!

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:37.120
I mean, it didn't even cross my mind.

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:43.490
- Y'know, she sounded kinda down when I talked to her.
- Maybe she just didn't want a call from ya.

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:44.880
It's not funny!

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:47.230
- Sorry to keep ya.
- Oh, she's here! - You're late!

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:53.870
Mitsuha, what happened to-?

00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:55.830
Your hair!

00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:58.980
I guess... it's weird.

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:10.880
You think it's gotta do with some guy.
Like, he broke her heart?

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:14.240
Guys always just assume that
it has to do with a boy.

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:21.130
- She said she felt like cuttin' it.
- Ya sure about that? You really think she felt like cuttin' off that much of it?

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:24.530
Hey guys, I can see it!

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:41.510
Huh?

00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:45.180
Whoa, ho-ho! - Whoa... - Ah.

00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:07.570
"The number you are trying to reach is currently outside
the cellular network or has been turned off due-"

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:15.090
I'll just have to tell her how lousy
the date ended up the next time we switch.

00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:17.400
That's what I thought.

00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:20.200
But, for some reason,

00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:24.400
the switches Mitsuha and I had
been going through until now...

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:28.190
they never happened again.

00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:03.870
"Mountains in Gifu Prefecture"

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:16.320
"Hida Mountains"

00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:20.340
Wha-

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:21.720
What are-

00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:24.330
What are you doing here?

00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:29.380
Tsukasa told me about it, so here I am.

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:37.680
I asked for two things: to cover my shift
and to back up my alibi if my dad asked.

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:39.760
Relax, Takagi's gonna take your shift.

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:41.180
Gotch'a covered!

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:43.150
But you owe me dinner.

00:46:43.310 --> 00:46:46.380
- So, you're all in on it...
- You've got everyone worried about you.

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:50.480
- Huh?
- We can't ignore this! What if somebody's trying to pull one over on you?

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:51.650
Like catfish?

00:46:51.830 --> 00:46:54.110
I mean, you met this person
online, didn't you?

00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:56.590
No, not exactly! It's kinda complicated.

00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:58.670
Could be from a dating site... She's NOT!

00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:03.410
It's because you've been acting awfully
fishy lately, so we're keeping an eye on you.

00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:05.130
I don't need a babysitter, okay!

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:12.790
The switches stopped, my calls never
connected, and texts never went through.

00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:17.480
That's why I decided to
go see Mitsuha in person.

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:20.490
I wanted to see her, but...

00:47:22.210 --> 00:47:27.540
-What? You don't know where she is exactly?
The town's landscape is your only clue?

00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:29.550
Yeah.

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:35.220
And you can't contact her?
What's that about?

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:38.800
Where are we? You're a terrible
tour guide... 'Cause I'm not one!

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:42.360
Oh, well. Guess we'll help you search.

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:47.020
- Aww, it's so cute! Look, Taki!
- Seriously, guys?

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:49.410
It moved! Awww!

00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:19.200
This is a lost cause.

00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:20.320
- What?!
- What?!

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:23.310
After everything that
we've done for you today?!

00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:28.470
You haven't done anything!

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:34.780
- One Takayama Ramen.
- One Takayama Ramen.

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:36.300
I guess I'll have the same.

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:37.640
Sure.

00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:40.130
- Three orders of ramen.
- Got it.

00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:46.210
- Think we can make it back to Tokyo tonight?
- Well, I think we'll be cuttin' it close.

00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:47.340
Let me take a look.

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:51.000
- K, thanks.
- Wait, Taki. You sure about that?

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:57.850
Yeah. I kinda feel like maybe I've been
barking up the wrong tree this whole time.

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:05.010
Hey, that's a sketch of Itomori, isn't it?

00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:08.490
It's drawn really well.

00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:10.890
Come take a look at this, hon!

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:14.840
Yeah, that's Itomori. Takes me back.

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:17.450
My husband was born and raised
there, you know.

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:19.790
Itomori?

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:25.450
Yes, of course! That's the place!
It's nearby, right?

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:26.940
You don't...?

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:28.850
Itomori was...

00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:30.790
Itomori...

00:49:30.810 --> 00:49:34.460
- But that's where-!
- Wait! Isn't that the area where that comet-?

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:36.660
Huh?

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:45.150
"Keep Out"

00:50:23.830 --> 00:50:24.960
Hey...

00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:27.090
Is this place really where she's from?

00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:31.000
No way. Taki must have just
confused this with somewhere else.

00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:33.110
No, I didn't.

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:35.230
This was the place.

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:37.540
The schoolyard, these mountains,

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:39.040
even this high school here!

00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:40.600
I remember it all!

00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:42.550
There's no way you could.

00:50:42.570 --> 00:50:46.380
You've gotta know about that
disaster three years ago, right?

00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:50.860
- Hundreds of people died.
- They died...

00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:52.910
three years ago?

00:50:52.930 --> 00:50:55.750
It can't be...

00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:57.750
There's no way...

00:50:57.770 --> 00:50:59.380
I mean...

00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:02.080
I still have the memos she wrote.

00:51:18.970 --> 00:51:22.680
They're fading.

00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:35.430
Comet Tiamat, with an orbital period
of 1,200 years,

00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:39.600
made a close approach to Earth
three years ago in October.

00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:39.630
Nobody foresaw that its nucleus
would split at its perigee.

00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:37.630
"Itomori, the Town that Vanished"

00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:41.630
"Meteor Strikes, Wipes out Town"

00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:44.770
"Town Annihilated"

00:51:44.890 --> 00:51:46.440
"Over 500 dead or missing"

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:48.020
"Itomori, the Town that Vanished"

00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:54.281
A fragment that broke off of it
became a meteor and struck Japan.

00:51:54.301 --> 00:51:55.831
"Itomori, comet, damage"

00:51:55.851 --> 00:51:59.800
It looks like that day was the
same date as the Autumn Festival.

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:02.330
The point of impact was here.

00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:07.730
At 8:42 PM, it fell right around
where people were gathered for the festival.

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:14.120
Over 500 died.

00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:16.700
It was a third of the town's population,

00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:16.730
and now, nobody lives in Itomori anymore.

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:13.670
"Names of the Victims"

00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:30.020
Teshigawara...

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.530
and Sayaka.

00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:37.530
That's her?!

00:52:37.550 --> 00:52:39.760
You were wrong! You gotta be!

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:43.520
After all,
this girl here died three years ago!

00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:48.260
Just... two or three weeks ago,
she said that I'd be able to see the comet.

00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:50.490
That means-!

00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:55.770
- "You're dreaming right now... aren't you?"
- I...

00:52:56.290 --> 00:52:59.470
I...

00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:00.470
What...

00:53:00.490 --> 00:53:01.490
was I?

00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:16.800
Sounds lively over there.

00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:19.800
They only have one room left.
I'm really sorry.

00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:21.730
It's not a problem.

00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:23.430
How's Taki?

00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:26.040
He's still reading articles on Itomori.

00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:30.740
He's goin' through all those newspapers
and magazines at random. Seems obsessive.

00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:38.230
- What is it?
- Oh, sorry. You smoke, huh?

00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:41.920
Yeah. I did quit at one point.

00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:45.950
What do you think about
what Taki's been saying?

00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:51.380
I had feelings for him, y'know.

00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:53.610
The way he's been recently.

00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:57.600
I mean, he was a nice guy
before, but he's even nicer now.

00:53:58.220 --> 00:54:00.600
Kind-of... frantic.

00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:02.630
It was cute.

00:54:02.650 --> 00:54:07.330
Although, I do think what he's been
telling us is definitely strange-sounding.

00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:15.290
But in the end, the fact remains that Taki's met
someone, and that someone is the reason he changed.

00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:18.151
That much is for sure.

"Worst-Ever Itomori Comet Disaster"

00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:35.580
It was all just a dream.

00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:38.430
I recognized the landscape

00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:42.970
because I unconsciously remembered
the news from three years ago.

00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:46.730
If it's not that, is she... a ghost?

00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:48.730
Or...

00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:50.620
did I just make it up?

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:52.300
The whole thing?

00:54:55.630 --> 00:54:58.140
What was her name?

00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:00.160
I can't remember.

00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:04.490
Tsukasa said he was gonna
go ahead and take a bath.

00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:06.260
Ms. Okudera,

00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:07.370
Uh...

00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:08.920
I, um...

00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:12.430
I realize I've been saying
a lot of strange things.

00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:14.960
I'm really sorry, and thank you.

00:55:23.796 --> 00:55:25.670
Braided cords. Pretty.

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:28.380
That band on your wrist.

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:31.330
- That's one, isn't it?
- Hm? Oh.

00:55:31.350 --> 00:55:33.070
This thing? Guess so.

00:55:33.090 --> 00:55:34.460
Somebody...

00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:36.840
Someone gave it to me.

00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:40.330
I wear it sometimes as...
kind-of a lucky charm.

00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:43.890
Who was it?

00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:51.840
- It's late. Why don't you go down and take a bath, too?
- Sure-wait.

00:55:54.170 --> 00:55:56.950
Yeah. Someone who makes these,

00:55:56.970 --> 00:55:58.950
they once told me something.

00:55:58.970 --> 00:56:01.950
The cords represent the flow of time.

00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:03.720
They twist and tangle,

00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:05.530
unravel and connect,

00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:08.580
and that's what time is.

00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:11.560
Maybe if I could-

00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:32.070
"Around here?"

00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:41.550

00:56:41.570 --> 00:56:44.560
Taki!

Don't you remember?!

00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:39.590
Taki...

00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:05.710
"I have to go somewhere. Go back to Tokyo
without me. I'll return later. Thanks."

00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:36.610
Eat this bento up there.

00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:41.870
Your drawing of Itomori.
You did a real good job.

00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:21.720
They assemble and take shape,

00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:23.460
they twist, tangle,

00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:25.140
unravel now and then,

00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:25.911
break,

00:58:25.931 --> 00:58:27.860
and reconnect.

00:58:28.490 --> 00:58:30.350
That's what a union is.

00:58:30.370 --> 00:58:32.800
What time is.

00:58:43.790 --> 00:58:46.250
There it is.

00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:48.880
It's really there!

00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:50.950
It wasn't...

00:58:50.970 --> 00:58:53.270
a dream.

It's still here.

00:59:52.690 --> 00:59:57.270
This was Yotsuha's, and this was mine.

00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:01.160
This was before the comet.

01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:03.870
So when I switched places with her,

01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:06.900
it was also three years in the past.

01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:11.910
Our times... got tangled somehow.

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:15.470
This is... half of her.

Musubi,

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:35.900
if it's true, and time can be unraveled,

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:38.970
just give me one more chance.

01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:50.840
Agh!

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:54.900
A comet!

01:01:00.930 --> 01:01:03.930
Ngh! Hh...

01:01:56.700 --> 01:02:00.820
Your name's going to be...

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:02.090
Mitsuha.

01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:10.930
Both of you are my treasures.

01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:13.210
You're going to be a big sister!

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:14.700
"Get well soon, Mom!"

01:02:15.970 --> 01:02:20.220
I'm so sorry, my dears...

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:23.890
Dad, when is mommy coming home?

01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:27.970
- I couldn't help her!
- Get a hold of yourself!

01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:31.240
- Who cares about the shrine?!
- But you're in charge now!

01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:35.170
- I loved Futaba, not Miyamizu Shrine!
- Get out!

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:40.430
Now listen to me, girls.

01:02:40.450 --> 01:02:44.890
Starting today,
you'll be living with grandma.

01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:49.070
"Mitsuha"

01:02:49.090 --> 01:02:50.321

"Who am I?" Who are you?

01:02:51.651 --> 01:02:51.690
"Idiot"

01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:53.180
Don't be full of yourself!

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.270
Like you have a girlfriend!

01:02:55.290 --> 01:02:56.690
Must be nice.

01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:59.220
They've probably met up about now.

01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:01.720
Why am I...?

01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:06.000
- I'm going to Tokyo.
- What?! Wait, Sis!

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:08.940
Grandma?

01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:11.970
Would you mind doing me a favor?

01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:14.990
Oh yeah, the comet.

01:03:15.010 --> 01:03:18.070
It'll be at its brightest today, right?

01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:20.490
Mitsuha, don't go there!

01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:22.520
Mitsuha!

01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:25.970
You've gotta get out of town
before the comet strikes!

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:30.520
Mitsuha, run!

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:37.260
Mitsuha! Mitsuha! Mitsuha!

01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:55.250
Mitsuha.

01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:57.900
She's alive!

01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:09.480
Let me guess, you're touching your boo-

01:04:10.850 --> 01:04:14.690
Her sister!

01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:18.230
Yotsuha!

01:04:18.250 --> 01:04:19.250
Ungh!

01:04:21.590 --> 01:04:24.070
I think she's finally lost it.

01:04:24.090 --> 01:04:27.440
Just for today,
I-I'm gonna head out first...

01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:28.760
She's lost it...

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:29.970
Really lost it...

01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:31.310
Totally!

01:04:31.330 --> 01:04:32.560
Totally...

01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:38.310
For all you stargazers out there, the comet Tiamat has
been visible to the naked eye for about a week now.

01:04:38.330 --> 01:04:44.670
Tonight, it will finally reach its perigee around 7:40 PM, and
be at its maximum brightness when viewed from the Earth's...

01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:47.660
It's tonight! There's still time left!

01:04:48.090 --> 01:04:50.130
Mornin', Mitsuha!

01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:52.420
What's this?

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:53.760
Hold on...

01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:57.620
- You're not Mitsuha, are you?
- W-wait, how did you-?

01:04:58.050 --> 01:05:00.080
You already knew?

01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:07.130
No, but watching the way you've been
behaving lately stirred some memories up.

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:09.800
When I was a young girl,

01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:12.920
I had some pretty strange dreams myself.

01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:13.721
Huh?

01:05:13.741 --> 01:05:20.620
Though it's been so long, the memories of who I became
in those dreams have pretty much faded at this point.

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:21.870
Faded?

01:05:21.890 --> 01:05:27.140
Treasure the experience.
Dreams eventually will fade away.

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:29.960
I went through similar times myself,

01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:32.630
and so did your mother.

01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:34.220
What if...

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.870
all those dreams that
the Miyamizu people had!

01:05:36.890 --> 01:05:39.230
It had to do with today!

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:42.650
Grandma, you have to listen to me!

01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:44.400
Tonight,

01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:46.710
the comet is going to fall on Itomori!

01:05:46.730 --> 01:05:49.120
- You're all gonna die!
- Huh?

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:57.300
"Nobody's gonna believe that?"

01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:00.250
I didn't expect that out
of Mitsuha's grandma.

01:06:00.270 --> 01:06:04.200
It doesn't matter!
There's no way I'm gonna let them all die!

01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:06.190
Mitsuha!

01:06:06.210 --> 01:06:07.750
What happened... to-?

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:10.460
What'd you-?

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:11.431
Your hair!

01:06:11.451 --> 01:06:15.920
- Ugh, the haircut? Looked better before, huh?
- No, i-i-it's good!

01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:20.630
Nevermind that! If we don't do
something about tonight, we'll all die!

01:06:22.350 --> 01:06:25.340
It's up to us to save everyone!

01:06:29.290 --> 01:06:31.330
Wait, shouldn't you be in school?

01:06:31.350 --> 01:06:36.040
Well, we sort-of have to save the
town, or something.

01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:37.060
Heh?

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:41.320
- The warning system?
- Yeah, those speakers all over the town.

01:06:41.410 --> 01:06:44.830
"Superimposition, frequency"

01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:48.200
I get it. It could work!

01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:52.460
- Niiiice job, Teshi.
- Hey, I don't think you should be sittin' so close to me.

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:56.070
- What's wrong. Uh-oh! You shyyy?
- Would you quit it?!

01:06:56.090 --> 01:06:58.320
It ain't proper and you know it!

01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:00.201
"Club Discontinued - Keep Out"

01:07:00.221 --> 01:07:01.750
T-hahahahaha!

01:07:01.770 --> 01:07:05.070
Such a gentleman.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.920
I bought all the snacks, guys.

01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:10.390
- Here's the change.
- Sorry for the trouble.

01:07:10.410 --> 01:07:11.410
I didn't mind.

01:07:11.530 --> 01:07:14.600
- We oughta be gettin' paid.
- Quit complaining.

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:17.590
So? Wha'dcha come up with?

01:07:17.610 --> 01:07:20.020
Got an evacuation plan?

01:07:23.030 --> 01:07:24.530
A- A-

01:07:24.550 --> 01:07:25.940
A BOMB?!

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:30.290
Yeah, we have water gel explosives we
use for construction at our storage site.

01:07:30.310 --> 01:07:32.950
AND the warning system?

01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:37.070
Our startup frequency can hijack the
town's warning system pretty easily,

01:07:37.090 --> 01:07:41.280
so we can broadcast an evacuation warning
for the whole town right from school!

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.610
Look, we're outside the disaster area here,

01:07:43.630 --> 01:07:46.390
so we'll just make an announcement
to evacuate to the school.

01:07:46.410 --> 01:07:47.700
It's-

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:50.900
- It's totally a crime!
- You'll be in charge of the broadcast, Saya.

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:53.410
- Why me?!
- You're in the Broadcast Club.

01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:57.180
- And I'll be in charge of the explosives.
- While I go have a word with the mayor.

01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:02.070
- Why?
- 'Cause if the evacuation order's not comin' from Town Hall, then nobody's gonna go anyway.

01:08:02.090 --> 01:08:05.400
But if I talk to the mayor,
as his daughter, I can convince him.

01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:08.070
It's the perfect plan!

01:08:08.650 --> 01:08:11.230
Fine, I don't really care
one way or the other.

01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:14.140
This is just a theory of yours, right?

01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:15.740
Well...

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:20.601
Theories can be based on reality. Like, do you know the
story of how Itomori Lake was formed? It's a crater!

01:08:20.621 --> 01:08:22.601
"A meteor crater lake
formed 1,200 years ago."

01:08:22.621 --> 01:08:28.020
- That means a meteor hit this area at least once a thousand years ago!
- Right. That's why-!

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:29.840
Nice one, Teshi!

01:08:33.570 --> 01:08:35.890
- Let's go evacuate the town!
- Let's go evacuate the town!

01:08:39.650 --> 01:08:42.660
What on earth are you talking about?!

01:08:43.670 --> 01:08:44.970
Like I said,

01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:49.950
We have to evacuate everyone in town
before tonight or else... Enough! Shut up!

01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:58.401
"The comet's going to split
in two and strike the town?"

01:08:58.421 --> 01:08:59.671
"Itomori Town Hall"

01:08:59.691 --> 01:09:01.070
"Over 500 will die?"

01:09:01.090 --> 01:09:04.570
How dare you stand there
and spout such nonsense!

01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:07.960
If you're serious, you must be sick!

01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:11.950
I guess recklessness is a Miyamizu trait.

01:09:12.770 --> 01:09:16.390
I'll have a car take you to the
city hospital for an examination.

01:09:16.410 --> 01:09:20.340
We will continue this discussion
after you've seen a doctor.

01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:23.840
You!

01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:27.970
You son of a-!

01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:35.960
Mitsuha...

01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:38.350
No...

01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:40.370
Wait a minute...

01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:43.550
Who are you?

01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:01.890
- I'll see you guys at the festival, ba-bye!
- We'll meet ya at the step stone shrine. Don't be late, k?

01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:04.870
Ba-bye! - Seeya! - Later!

01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:07.650
You shouldn't go!

01:10:07.670 --> 01:10:11.820
- You've got to leave town! Tell all of your friends!
- What's wrong with you?!

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:15.240
- Mitsuha! - What was that about?
- Come on, let's go.

01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:17.660
What are you doing, huh?

01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:19.970
If it was Mitsuha,

01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:22.260
would she have been able to convince him?

01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:24.130
- Is all this my fault?!
- Huh?!

01:10:24.150 --> 01:10:27.870
Yotsuha, promise me that you'll
leave town with grandma before dark!

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:28.511
What?!

01:10:28.531 --> 01:10:31.610
- You're gonna die if you stay here!
- What are you talking about?!

01:10:31.630 --> 01:10:37.490
And why did you suddenly go to Tokyo yesterday?!
You've been acting really strange lately!

01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:42.720
- Went to Tokyo?
- Hey! Mitsuha!

01:10:44.670 --> 01:10:46.930
How'd it go with your old man?

01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:51.200
Hey, Mitsuha!

01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:52.850
What's with your sister?

01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:55.250
Don't know.

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:06.380
Could she be over there?

01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:08.860
What's that? What's over there?

01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:11.980
- Let me use your bike, Teshi.
- Hey.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.010
Mitsuha.

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:16.010
And what do we do?

01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:18.150
Get things ready like we planned!

01:11:18.170 --> 01:11:20.900
I'm counting on you!

01:11:46.330 --> 01:11:48.980
Oh my gosh! I'm Taki again!

01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:54.600
What's Taki doin' out here?

01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:05.430
The town!

01:12:05.450 --> 01:12:07.340
It's gone!

01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:17.980
So...

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:19.980
does that mean...

01:12:22.330 --> 01:12:24.890
I... died?!

01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:36.670
"Taki."

01:12:36.690 --> 01:12:39.000
"Taki!"

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:41.780
"Don't you remember?!"

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:56.510
I'm going to Tokyo for a few hours.

01:12:56.530 --> 01:12:58.330
Wha? Right now?

01:12:58.350 --> 01:12:59.760
- But why?
- Uh...

01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:01.170
For a date.

01:13:01.190 --> 01:13:05.300
- You have a boyfriend in Tokyo?!
- I-I didn't say it was a date for me.

01:13:06.710 --> 01:13:08.980
"I'll be back tonight."

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:16.960
If I suddenly show up, will it
be a nuisance or a surprise?

01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:19.980
He might not like it if I do.

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:31.330
"The number you are trying to reach
is currently outside the cellular network."

01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:34.580
I guess it won't happen, but...

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:36.600
What if it did?

01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:38.550
What would I do?

01:13:38.570 --> 01:13:40.600
Would I annoy him?

01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:40.630
Would it be awkward, or maybe...

01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:43.320
"Tiamat Makes Closest Approach Tomorrow"

01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:47.980
he'd be glad to see me.

01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:52.580
"The number you are trying to reach
is currently outside the cellular network."

01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:55.860
I guess we won't meet.

01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:01.850
But... there's one thing I'm certain of.

01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:04.490
If we see each other,

01:14:04.510 --> 01:14:07.310
We'll definitely know right away...

01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:11.500
that you were the one who was in me,

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:14.770
and that I was the one who was in...

01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:16.540
- you.
- Sorry!

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:49.990
'Scuse me.

01:15:09.730 --> 01:15:12.000
Agh!

01:15:21.410 --> 01:15:22.610
That time...

01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:24.210
three years ago.

01:15:24.230 --> 01:15:26.290
Before I even knew you...

01:15:29.490 --> 01:15:31.810
Taki...

01:15:31.830 --> 01:15:34.780
Taki?

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:37.010
- Taki!
- Huh?

01:15:37.130 --> 01:15:40.000
Uh... It's me!

01:15:41.710 --> 01:15:44.410
- Don't you... remember?
- Uh...

01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:48.010
Sorry, who are you?

01:15:51.610 --> 01:15:53.470
I- I'm sorry.

01:15:56.690 --> 01:15:58.000
Ah!

01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:03.000
But, he's Taki!

01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:04.960
What a weird girl.

01:16:05.190 --> 01:16:09.070
"Yotsuya. Yotsuya.
Stay clear of the doors."

01:16:14.110 --> 01:16:15.620
- Hold on!
- Huh?

01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:17.620
- Egh!
- What's your name?

01:16:18.410 --> 01:16:20.080
Mitsuha!

01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:21.340
My name is...

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:23.480
"Mitsuha!"

01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:31.210
Three years ago...

01:16:31.230 --> 01:16:33.210
you showed up.

01:16:33.230 --> 01:16:37.010
It was... to see me!

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.950
Taki.

01:16:57.510 --> 01:17:00.350
Mitsuha!

01:17:00.370 --> 01:17:02.700
Taki?

01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:18.330
Mitsuha!

01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:20.490
You're here, right?

01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:22.510
Inside my body?

01:17:22.530 --> 01:17:24.720
Taki?!

01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:27.070
Taki, where are you?!

01:17:27.090 --> 01:17:29.240
That was Mitsuha.

01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:31.150
I can hear her voice, but...

01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:34.860
Taki, where are you?

01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:37.210
Taki!!

01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:42.950
- Uh!
- Huh?

01:17:49.650 --> 01:17:54.900
- Taki, are you...?
- Are you there?

01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:21.050
- Magic hour.
- Magic hour.

01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:25.040
Uh...

01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:36.930
Mitsuha.

01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:44.870
Taki.

01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:47.020
Taki!

01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:49.750
You're really here!

01:18:53.950 --> 01:18:57.100
- Taki!
- I came all this way to see you,

01:18:57.280 --> 01:18:59.150
which wasn't easy...

01:18:59.170 --> 01:19:01.650
since you were pretty far away.

01:19:02.770 --> 01:19:04.560
How is that even...?

01:19:04.580 --> 01:19:06.210
Because, back then!

01:19:06.230 --> 01:19:09.420
Well, I drank some of your kuchikamizake.

01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:11.370
Huh?

01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:13.050
Oh...

01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:15.210
You... you drank that?!

01:19:15.230 --> 01:19:15.941
Huh?

01:19:15.961 --> 01:19:18.240
- STUPID PERVERT!
- Wha-WHA?!

01:19:18.260 --> 01:19:21.250
Yeah, that's right! You were
touching my boobies, WEREN'T YOU?!

01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:22.121
WHA-?!

01:19:22.141 --> 01:19:24.950
- Wha-ho-how do you even-?!
- 'Cause Yotsuha saw you!

01:19:24.970 --> 01:19:27.440
I just-I couldn't help myself!

01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:30.700
- But it was just the one time!
- "Just the one time?"

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:35.350
How many times is it the issue?!

01:19:35.370 --> 01:19:36.740
Sorry!

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:37.950
Wait...

01:19:37.970 --> 01:19:39.070
Is that...?

01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:40.231
Oh.

01:19:40.251 --> 01:19:43.710
Yeah, it's yours,
but you visited before I knew you.

01:19:43.730 --> 01:19:46.010
So, I didn't know who you were.

01:19:46.410 --> 01:19:47.920
Here.

01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:50.310
I kept it for three years,

01:19:50.330 --> 01:19:54.030
but I think it's time you got it back.

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:05.540
- Whaddya think?
- Oh, uh, well...

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:10.110
- it's not bad.
- Oh, you're lyin'!

01:20:10.130 --> 01:20:10.821
Busted!

01:20:10.841 --> 01:20:13.420
Why you gotta be like that?

01:20:27.410 --> 01:20:29.130
Hey, Mitsuha.

01:20:29.150 --> 01:20:31.210
You still have a lot to do.

01:20:31.230 --> 01:20:32.770
Listen.

01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:35.420
- It's coming.
- Don't worry.

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:37.770
You still have enough time.

01:20:37.790 --> 01:20:39.730
I'll do my best.

01:20:40.650 --> 01:20:43.420
It looks like magic hour is almost...

01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:45.040
over.

01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:48.280
Hey, Mitsuha.

01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:51.590
Just so we don't forget
things when we wake up...

01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:58.000
Let's write down our names.

01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:00.180
Here.

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:13.010
Mitsuha.

01:21:14.810 --> 01:21:16.140
Hey.

01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:18.160
Mitsuha?

01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:28.030
I was planning to tell you...

01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:30.910
that wherever you are in the world,

01:21:30.930 --> 01:21:35.060
I swear that I'll find you
again, no matter what.

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:38.580
Your name...

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:40.590
is Mitsuha.

01:21:41.170 --> 01:21:42.380
It'll be okay!

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:43.940
I'll remember!

01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:44.700
Mitsuha.

01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:45.640
Mitsuha.

01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:46.631
Mitsuha!

01:21:46.651 --> 01:21:48.060
Your name is Mitsuha!

01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:49.350
Your name is-!

01:22:00.570 --> 01:22:02.060
Who...

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:04.080
are you?

01:22:05.130 --> 01:22:06.200
And what...

01:22:06.220 --> 01:22:08.950
did I even come here for?

01:22:08.970 --> 01:22:09.931
I came...

01:22:09.951 --> 01:22:12.200
I came all this way to see her!

01:22:12.220 --> 01:22:13.950
I came to save her!

01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:16.130
I wanted her to be alive!

01:22:16.150 --> 01:22:17.630
Who was it again?

01:22:17.650 --> 01:22:18.660
Who?

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:20.610
Who did I come to see?

01:22:20.630 --> 01:22:22.190
Someone precious!

01:22:22.210 --> 01:22:24.620
Someone I don't wanna forget!

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:26.770
Someone I shouldn't!

01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:28.190
Who was it?

01:22:28.210 --> 01:22:29.770
Who was it?!

01:22:29.790 --> 01:22:30.790
Who?!

01:22:30.930 --> 01:22:31.911
Who?!

01:22:31.931 --> 01:22:34.770
What's your name?!

01:22:48.490 --> 01:22:49.760
Taki.

01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:50.840
Taki.

01:22:50.860 --> 01:22:52.250
Taki.

01:22:52.270 --> 01:22:53.500
It'll be fine!

01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:54.700
I remember!

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.440
I'll never forget!

01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:57.520
Taki.

01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:58.880
Taki.

01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:00.170
Your name is...

01:23:00.190 --> 01:23:03.040
Taki!

01:23:11.450 --> 01:23:13.450
"Itomori Substation"

01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:17.890
Teshi!

01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:18.910
Mitsuha!

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:22.710
- Where the heck have you been?
- He said sorry for breakin' your bike.

01:23:22.730 --> 01:23:24.470
Wha? Who did?

01:23:24.490 --> 01:23:26.050
I did!

01:23:26.630 --> 01:23:29.580
You're gonna have to
explain it to me later.

01:23:33.370 --> 01:23:35.340
That thing is gonna fall, right?

01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:38.530
- For real?
- For real. I saw it with my own eyes.

01:23:38.550 --> 01:23:41.340
What? You did, huh?

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:44.070
Well, I guess it's settled, then.

01:23:44.090 --> 01:23:46.510
We're both officially criminals.

01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:47.950
What?! Do I really have to...?!

01:23:47.290 --> 01:23:49.290
"Broadcasting Room"

01:23:51.310 --> 01:23:55.390
Once the town's power goes out, the emergency
generator should kick in right away.

01:23:55.410 --> 01:23:57.570
Use the broadcast equipment once it does.

01:23:57.590 --> 01:24:00.950
Don't be scared, Saya!
And repeat it as many times as you can!

01:24:00.970 --> 01:24:02.330
Woo-hoo!

01:24:02.350 --> 01:24:07.310
- You can do it!
- Aw, nuts! It's do or die!

01:24:13.150 --> 01:24:16.340
- Shouldn't it be goin' off?
- Hell if I know!

01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:26.910
- Oooh...
- Ha ha!

01:24:27.170 --> 01:24:29.060
- What was that?
- It was pretty loud, too.

01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:31.020
Look over there!

01:24:55.410 --> 01:24:59.050
- Hey look, up there!
- Whoa!

01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:10.090
This is Itomori Town Hall!

01:25:10.110 --> 01:25:15.040
- Reports of an explosion at the substation are coming in!
- An explosion? Did I hear that right?

01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:19.600
Wildfires are possible,
as well as the threat of more explosions!

01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:25.900
Residents in the followin' areas, please
evacuate to Itomori High School immediately.

01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:28.590
Kadoiri District.

01:25:28.610 --> 01:25:31.200
- Sakagami District!
- Honey, we should go.

01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:34.650
The broadcast isn't coming from us?
Well, who the hell is it, then?

01:25:34.670 --> 01:25:36.800
Miyamori District.

01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:39.980
Oyazawa District.

01:25:40.060 --> 01:25:42.250
Let's go, Mitsuha!

01:25:43.670 --> 01:25:45.080
Teshi!

01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:56.640
- Everyone, run! There's a wildfire!
- Wildfire, please run!

01:25:56.660 --> 01:26:01.510
- Get outta here! Run, there's a fire!
- It's not safe here! Please, evacuate!

01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:04.140
It's not workin',
we're runnin' out of time!

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.650
Mitsuha!

01:26:06.670 --> 01:26:08.070
What's wrong?

01:26:08.570 --> 01:26:10.620
What is it...?

01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:14.050
I can't remember what his name is anymore!

01:26:15.370 --> 01:26:19.210
What is with you?!
You're the one who started all of this!

01:26:19.230 --> 01:26:22.690
We can't evacuate everyone
without firefighters!

01:26:22.710 --> 01:26:25.970
Get goin'! You gotta convince your old man!

01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:37.170
Everybody, get to the high school! HURRY!

01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:41.060
Oh, it's Mitsuha.

01:26:43.830 --> 01:26:48.750
- Why would terrorists attack way out here? What is Chubu Electric saying?
- They're still checking.

01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:51.260
Any update? No wildfires yet?

01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:53.370
You sure? Got it.

01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:58.490
Make them stop this broadcast immediately!
Haven't you located its source yet?

01:26:58.510 --> 01:27:01.460
Mayor, the Takayama sensor
station just called!

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:04.120
From the high school?

01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:09.840
Once again, residents in the following
areas, please evacuate to Itomori High...

01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:12.740
- Ah!
- What are you doing?! Turn that off!

01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:17.680
- They got Saya!
- Oh no.

01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:23.860
What were you thinking, Natori?! I swear!

01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:30.840
This is Itomori Town Hall.

01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:35.390
We are currently confirming
the reports of the accident.

01:27:35.570 --> 01:27:42.260
- We instruct all residents to remain calm and stay where they are until further notice.
- I guess... we have to stay put?

01:27:42.510 --> 01:27:44.780
- What is goin' on?
- So stay on standby.

01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:50.420
Come on! They said everyone should evacuate!
The high school's the evacuation center!

01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:52.580
Katsuhiko!

01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:55.801
Tell me...

01:27:55.821 --> 01:27:58.590
What do you think you're doing?!

01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:02.570
Sorry, Mitsuha.

01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:05.520
This is the end.

01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:08.580
Oh, my God!

01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:11.410
It's actually splittin' apart!

01:28:17.790 --> 01:28:23.970
Look at that! The comet has split into two large
parts and meteors are now falling to Earth!

01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:28.440
- Uh, I don't believe anyone could have predicted this.
- Either way, we have quite the mystical view here.

01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:31.930
So, what does the comet's
nucleus splitting mean for us?

01:28:31.950 --> 01:28:37.760
The comet's not within the Roche limit, so the nucleus
itself must've had a structural weakness for this to happen.

01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:42.610
Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 broke apart
and collided with Jupiter in 1994.

01:28:43.150 --> 01:28:45.290
- There were at least 21 fragments...
- I'm going outside to take a look.

01:28:45.310 --> 01:28:48.720
- The fragments will likely burn up well before reaching the ground.
- Does it pose a danger?

01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:53.090
Probability of a meteor actually landing
on a populated area is quite small.

01:28:53.110 --> 01:28:54.720
Never foresaw this development.

01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:58.840
- To predict the trajectory...
- As we stand here witnessing this spectacle,

01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:00.340
unassisted...

01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:01.660
and with our bare eyes,

01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:07.060
it strikes me that living in such an age
has never felt more fortunate than now.

01:29:09.670 --> 01:29:10.790
Hey...

01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:12.380
Who...

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:14.090
are you?

01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:18.290
Who?

01:29:18.650 --> 01:29:20.330
Who?

01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:22.330
Who is he?

01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:24.100
Someone precious.

01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:26.090
Someone I shouldn't forget!

01:29:26.110 --> 01:29:28.810
Someone I didn't want to!

01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:30.500
Who?

01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:31.580
Who?!

01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:33.480
Who are you?!

01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:36.240
What's your name?!

01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:42.550
Oh no!

01:29:42.610 --> 01:29:43.970
Ah! Argh!

01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:48.870
Ungh!

01:30:01.930 --> 01:30:04.490
"So that we don't forget
things when we wake up..."

01:30:04.510 --> 01:30:07.090
"Let's write down our names."

01:30:15.210 --> 01:30:18.610
"I love you"

01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:35.240
Writing this...

01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:36.870
doesn't help!

01:30:36.890 --> 01:30:39.170
I won't know your name...

01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:54.380
Dad!

01:30:54.930 --> 01:30:56.980
- Mitsuha.
- There you are!

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.190
Don't tell me you're back!

01:30:59.210 --> 01:31:01.100
Ah...

01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:06.190
"It was almost like seeing
something out of a dream."

01:31:06.610 --> 01:31:08.420
"Nothing more or less..."

01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:10.780
"than a breathtaking view."

01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:15.190
Words like "tomorrow"
or "future" or "fate",

01:31:15.210 --> 01:31:18.990
no matter how far they extend their hands,

01:31:19.010 --> 01:31:22.800
we breathe, we dream, we raise our love

01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:26.940
in a timeless land
that is far out of reach.

01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:30.610
Even the second, hour hands of the clock.

01:31:30.630 --> 01:31:34.640
They look at us sideways
as they tick and tock.

01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:39.500
How I hope to have
forever to spend this life,

01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:41.920
no-all future lives

01:31:41.940 --> 01:31:49.740
right here in this world with you!

01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:43.960
Huh?

01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:45.990
Why am I here?

01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:50.090
What am I... doing?

01:33:08.690 --> 01:33:09.800
U-uh!

01:33:14.430 --> 01:33:18.130
"The doors are closing. Please be careful."

01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:23.500
I'm always searching for something.

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:27.130
This... feeling has consumed me...

01:33:27.150 --> 01:33:29.110
for some time.

01:33:30.410 --> 01:33:32.450
The reason I applied for this position-

01:33:32.470 --> 01:33:33.990
The landscapes people live in-

01:33:34.010 --> 01:33:35.940
To build a city's landscape-

01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:38.900
Even Tokyo. It might vanish too one day.

01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:43.310
And so, I wanna make landscapes
that-how should I put this?

01:33:43.330 --> 01:33:46.800
That can continue to warm peoples' hearts.

01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:50.750
That bad? How many does that make it?

01:33:50.770 --> 01:33:53.500
- I've stopped counting.
- Doesn't sound too promising.

01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:56.090
- Who asked you?
- That suit could be the problem.

01:33:56.110 --> 01:33:57.860
It looks just like yours!

01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:01.290
- Well, I have two offers.
- I have eight myself.

01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:06.390
"LINE: You have a new message."

01:34:06.410 --> 01:34:08.480
Is what I'm searching for...

01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:09.980
someone?

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:11.490
Or somewhere?

01:34:12.230 --> 01:34:15.490
Or am I just searching for the right job?

01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:17.440
I don't even really know.

01:34:18.150 --> 01:34:19.320
Oh!

01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:23.200
- You're job hunting, huh?
- I haven't had much luck, though.

01:34:23.220 --> 01:34:28.070
- Hey, maybe it's the suit that's killing your chances.
- Uh-does it really look that bad on me?

01:34:32.380 --> 01:34:34.960
So, why the sudden call today?

01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:40.121
I was in the area for work and I figured
it had been a while since I saw your face.

01:34:40.141 --> 01:34:42.636
"8 years since the comet disaster"

01:34:42.656 --> 01:34:46.180
Remember that one time when we
went all the way to Itomori?

01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:49.460
You were still in high school back
then, so it was...

01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:52.710
- Heh. Five years ago.
- That long?

01:34:53.290 --> 01:34:54.640
It seems like...

01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:57.260
I've forgotten a lot.

01:34:57.540 --> 01:35:00.060
I don't... remember all that much, either.

01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:01.830
About back then.

01:35:02.220 --> 01:35:04.310
Maybe we argued.

01:35:04.330 --> 01:35:07.590
She and Tsukasa went
back to Tokyo without me.

01:35:08.110 --> 01:35:11.140
I spent the night alone on some mountain.

01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:14.110
That's about all I remember.

01:35:16.470 --> 01:35:23.460
But, at one point in time, I found myself strangely
drawn to the incident involving that comet.

01:35:25.630 --> 01:35:29.111
A fragment of the comet destroyed
a town in that disaster,

01:35:29.131 --> 01:35:29.570
"Evacuation of residents to
high school grounds confirmed."

01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:31.110
but, miraculously,

01:35:31.130 --> 01:35:34.340
most of the people living
in the town were unhurt.

01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:35.360
The town happened to be holding
an emergency drill that day,

01:35:35.380 --> 01:35:37.370
"No deaths, 104 wounded"

01:35:37.390 --> 01:35:39.251
"An unprecedented natural disaster"

01:35:39.271 --> 01:35:40.360
and most of its residents
were outside the impact zone.

01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:42.360
"Residents safe"

01:35:42.380 --> 01:35:43.371
"Disaster Foretold?"

01:35:43.391 --> 01:35:47.156
The sheer luck and coincidence of it
all sparked various conspiracy theories.

01:35:47.176 --> 01:35:49.041
"Mayor Miyamizu's hidden agenda"

01:35:49.061 --> 01:35:49.610
I read a lot articles about it back then.

01:35:49.630 --> 01:35:51.656
"Mysterious explosion at the substation"

01:35:51.676 --> 01:35:53.120
I was kind-of obsessed.

01:35:53.770 --> 01:35:59.130
But whatever the reason I had for my
interest... is a mystery to me now.

01:36:00.490 --> 01:36:03.140
I didn't even know anybody in that town.

01:36:06.510 --> 01:36:09.240
Thanks for today. This is far enough.

01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:12.200
I do hope,

01:36:12.220 --> 01:36:14.100
that at some point,

01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:17.120
you'll find happiness, too.

01:36:19.900 --> 01:36:22.810
I feel like I'm always searching.

01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:24.550
For something.

01:36:24.570 --> 01:36:26.160
Someone.

01:36:31.710 --> 01:36:34.170
"Construction company job interview"

01:36:37.230 --> 01:36:40.360
I feel like I do wanna go
to one more bridal fair.

01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:41.760
They're all the same!

01:36:41.780 --> 01:36:46.740
- A Shinto weddin' sure sounds nice, too!
- You said you wanted to be married in a chapel!

01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:48.821
- Oh, that reminds me, Teshi!
- Uh!

01:36:48.841 --> 01:36:53.500
Would ya please shave before the ceremony?
I'm goin' on a diet for it, you know.

01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:55.620
She says as she's eatin' a cake!

01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:58.850
- I'll get serious tomorrow.
- Uh...

01:37:42.050 --> 01:37:43.170
"Itomori, the Town that Vanished"

01:37:43.190 --> 01:37:45.550
"October 4, 2013 - Itomori Vanished"

01:37:45.570 --> 01:37:47.550

"Itomori Elementary School"

01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:52.070
"Miyamizu Shrine"

01:37:56.590 --> 01:37:59.780
The landscape of a town
that's no longer there.

01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:04.090
Why does looking at it make
my chest feel so tight?

01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:43.150
Now, just a little more,

01:38:43.170 --> 01:38:46.330
only just a little more.

01:38:46.350 --> 01:38:52.440
Let's stay here a little longer now.

01:38:52.460 --> 01:38:54.620
Just a little more,

01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:57.870
only just a little more.

01:38:57.890 --> 01:39:02.390
Let's stick together
just a little bit longer.

01:39:03.910 --> 01:39:06.120
Just a little more,

01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:09.290
only just a little more.

01:39:09.310 --> 01:39:14.500
Let's stay here a little longer now.

01:39:15.030 --> 01:39:17.500
Now just a little more,

01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:20.650
only just a little more.

01:39:20.670 --> 01:39:24.070
Let's stick together
just a little bit longer.

01:39:24.090 --> 01:39:28.360
- I was always searching...
- Searching for...

01:39:28.380 --> 01:39:29.510
someone!

01:39:29.530 --> 01:39:31.770
Oh yes, we are time fliers,

01:39:31.790 --> 01:39:34.640
scaling the walls of time. Climber

01:39:34.660 --> 01:39:39.350
tired of playing
hide-and-seek with time and

01:39:39.370 --> 01:39:41.470
always comin' dead short.

01:39:41.490 --> 01:39:43.280
I'll never let you go now,

01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:45.770
promise I will never let you go now,

01:39:45.790 --> 01:39:48.480
'cause my hand finally has reached yours!

01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:51.170
Why should I have to?

01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:54.730
Oh, you're sure quite a showy crier.

01:39:54.750 --> 01:39:56.090
Wanna stop your tears,

01:39:56.110 --> 01:39:57.580
see your eyes drier.

01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:00.800
But when I went to wipe your tears dry,

01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:04.340
you refused, but I saw them
pouring down your face, I knew why.

01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:06.040
Crying even when you're happy,

01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:08.670
smiling even when you're feeling lonely.

01:40:08.690 --> 01:40:10.630
It's because a part of you

01:40:10.650 --> 01:40:13.570
has made it here before the rest has.

01:40:27.260 --> 01:40:28.880
Excuse me!

01:40:28.900 --> 01:40:30.500
Haven't we...?

01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:31.401
Have I...

01:40:31.421 --> 01:40:34.140
met you somewhere?

01:40:41.730 --> 01:40:43.860
I thought so, too!

01:40:47.860 --> 01:40:49.380
- Can I ask you...
- Can I ask you...

01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:50.850
- your name?
- your name?

01:40:51.370 --> 01:40:57.260
The sorrowful gust of wind that
blew right between you and me,

01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:03.000
where did it find the loneliness
it carried on the breeze?

01:41:03.020 --> 01:41:08.760
Looking up at the sky after
shedding a stream of tears,

01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:14.390
I could see for miles of blue,
it's never been so clear.

01:41:25.730 --> 01:41:31.510
Speeches that my father gave me
would always make me despair.

01:41:31.530 --> 01:41:37.130
Somehow, I feel a warmth and comfort today.

01:41:37.150 --> 01:41:42.910
Your ever kind heart, the way you smile,
and even how you find your dreams.

01:41:42.930 --> 01:41:48.410
I knew nothing, so honestly,
I've always copied you.

01:41:48.430 --> 01:41:50.890
Now, just a little more,

01:41:50.910 --> 01:41:54.150
only just a little more.

01:41:54.170 --> 01:41:58.790
Let's stay here a little longer now.

01:41:59.890 --> 01:42:02.390
Now just a little more,

01:42:02.410 --> 01:42:05.590
only just a little more.

01:42:05.610 --> 01:42:10.200
Let's stick together
just a little bit longer.

01:42:14.290 --> 01:42:16.590
Oh yes, we are time fliers

01:42:16.610 --> 01:42:19.470
scaling the walls of time. Climber

01:42:19.490 --> 01:42:24.160
tired of playing hide-and-seek
with time and

01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:26.260
always comin' dead short.

01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:27.950
Crying even when you're happy,

01:42:27.970 --> 01:42:30.580
smiling even when you're feeling lonely.

01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:35.340
It's because a part of you has
made it here before the rest has.

01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:02.910
I used to wish upon the stars,
the toys that I once adored.

01:43:02.930 --> 01:43:08.860
Forgotten now, are rollin'
'round the corners of the floor.

01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:14.470
Finally, my dream has counted
up to a hundred today.

01:43:14.490 --> 01:43:20.310
Someday, I'll trade them
all for just the very one.

01:43:26.030 --> 01:43:31.730
Girl that I have seen in school,
that never have told "hello",

01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:37.350
After class today, I waved and
said, “See you tomorrow!”

01:43:37.370 --> 01:43:43.000
It's not really that bad trying
something new every once in a while,

01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:48.500
especially if I can do
it with you by my side.

01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:51.030
Now just a little more,

01:43:51.050 --> 01:43:54.220
only just a little more.

01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:59.120
Let's stay here a little longer now.

01:44:00.290 --> 01:44:02.470
Just a little more,

01:44:02.490 --> 01:44:05.690
only just a little more.

01:44:05.710 --> 01:44:10.100
Let's stick together
just a little bit longer.

01:44:14.410 --> 01:44:17.830
Oh yes, we are time fliers, so, and I...

01:44:17.850 --> 01:44:20.710
I knew who you were way before...

01:44:20.730 --> 01:44:23.870
way before I even knew my own name.

01:44:23.890 --> 01:44:30.370
There's no clue, but I'm sure. I swear!

01:44:32.190 --> 01:44:34.990
Even if you're not around
in this wide world,

01:44:35.010 --> 01:44:37.820
of course it surely would
have some kind of meaning.

01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:40.730
But if when you're not
around in this crazy world,

01:44:40.750 --> 01:44:43.790
would be like the month of
August without summer break.

01:44:43.810 --> 01:44:46.440
And if you're not around
in this great world,

01:44:46.460 --> 01:44:49.690
would be like Santa Claus without any glee.

01:44:49.710 --> 01:44:57.710
If you're not around in this wide world!

01:45:23.110 --> 01:45:25.270
Oh yes, we are time fliers

01:45:25.290 --> 01:45:28.210
scaling the walls of time. Climber

01:45:28.230 --> 01:45:32.900
tired of playing hide-and-seek
with time and

01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:34.990
always comin' dead short.

01:45:35.010 --> 01:45:36.770
No, never mind that!

01:45:36.790 --> 01:45:39.330
No, never mind what I said now,

01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:42.400
'cause I'm on my way to you!

01:45:43.980 --> 01:45:46.150
Oh, we are time fliers,

01:45:46.170 --> 01:45:49.000
dashing up the steps of time now!

01:45:49.020 --> 01:45:53.670
No more playing hide-and-seek
with you and time

01:45:53.690 --> 01:45:55.750
and always comin' dead short!

01:45:55.770 --> 01:45:57.580
You're quite a showy crier!

01:45:57.600 --> 01:45:58.930
Wanna stop your tears,

01:45:58.950 --> 01:46:00.430
see your eyes drier!

01:46:00.450 --> 01:46:03.650
But when I went to wipe your tears dry,

01:46:03.670 --> 01:46:07.210
you refused but I saw them pouring
down your face, I knew why!

01:46:07.230 --> 01:46:08.900
Crying even when I'm happy,

01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:11.520
smiling even when I'm feeling lonely!

01:46:11.540 --> 01:46:13.510
It's because the heart of mine

01:46:13.530 --> 01:46:17.270
has made it here before my body.
