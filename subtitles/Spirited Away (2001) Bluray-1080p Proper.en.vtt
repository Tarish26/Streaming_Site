WEBVTT

00:00:14.183 --> 00:00:17.949
"I'll miss you, Chihiro.
Your best friend, Rumi."

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.012
Chihiro.
Chihiro, we're almost there.

00:00:23.058 --> 00:00:25.754
This really is in
the middle of nowhere.

00:00:25.828 --> 00:00:28.558
I'm gonna have to
go to the next town to shop.

00:00:28.631 --> 00:00:30.861
We'll just have to learn to like it.

00:00:33.068 --> 00:00:36.902
Look, Chihiro, there's your new school.
Looks great, doesn't it?

00:00:36.972 --> 00:00:40.100
It doesn't look so bad.

00:00:47.183 --> 00:00:51.483
It's gonna stink.
I liked my old school.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.924
Mom! My flowers are dying.

00:00:56.992 --> 00:00:59.654
I told you not to
smother them like that.

00:00:59.728 --> 00:01:03.789
We'll put them in water
when we get to our new home.

00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:07.563
I finally get a bouquet, and it's
a good-bye present. That's depressing.

00:01:07.636 --> 00:01:11.003
Daddy bought you a rose for
your birthday. Don't you remember?

00:01:11.073 --> 00:01:14.065
Yeah, one.
Just one rose isn't a bouquet.

00:01:14.143 --> 00:01:16.907
Hold on to your card.
I'm opening the window.

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.608
And quit whining.
It's fun to move to a new place.

00:01:20.683 --> 00:01:22.674
It's an adventure.

00:01:57.085 --> 00:01:59.883
Wait. Did I take the wrong turn?

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.280
This can't be right.

00:02:03.358 --> 00:02:05.792
- Look, there's our house.
- Huh?

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.294
It's that blue one on the end.

00:02:08.363 --> 00:02:12.129
Oh, you're right.
I must have missed the turnoff.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.634
This road should get us there.

00:02:14.702 --> 00:02:17.034
Don't take a shortcut.
You always get us lost.

00:02:17.105 --> 00:02:20.074
- Trust me. It's gonna work.
- What are those stones?

00:02:20.141 --> 00:02:23.076
- They look like little houses.
- They're shrines.

00:02:23.144 --> 00:02:26.113
Some people think
little spirits live there.

00:02:30.585 --> 00:02:35.045
- Dad, I think we're lost.
- We're fine. I've got four-wheel drive.

00:02:35.123 --> 00:02:37.216
- Sit down, please, sweetie.

00:02:54.442 --> 00:02:56.273
- Honey! Honey!

00:02:56.344 --> 00:02:59.711
- Slow down! You're gonna kill us.

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.840
What's that?

00:03:17.232 --> 00:03:21.430
- What's this old building?
- It looks like an entrance.

00:03:21.503 --> 00:03:25.132
Honey, get back in the car.
We're going to be late.

00:03:25.206 --> 00:03:27.265
Chihiro.

00:03:27.342 --> 00:03:29.276
Oh, for heaven's sake.

00:03:29.344 --> 00:03:32.040
This building's not old. It's fake.

00:03:32.113 --> 00:03:34.377
These stones are
just made of plaster.

00:03:43.825 --> 00:03:45.759
- The wind's pulling us in.

00:03:45.827 --> 00:03:49.763
- What is it?
- Let's go in. I want to see
what's on the other side.

00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:52.493
I'm not going.
It gives me the creeps.

00:03:52.567 --> 00:03:55.263
Don't be such
a scaredy-cat, Chihiro.

00:03:55.336 --> 00:03:59.272
- Let's just take a look.
- The movers will get to
our house before we do.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.071
It's all right. They've got the keys.
They can start without us.

00:04:03.144 --> 00:04:06.705
- All right. Just a quick look.
- Forget it. I'm not going.

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.381
Come on, you guys.
Let's get out of here.

00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:12.385
Come on, honey. It'll be fun.

00:04:12.453 --> 00:04:14.887
I'm not going!

00:04:22.263 --> 00:04:25.164
Chihiro, just wait in the car then.

00:04:25.233 --> 00:04:28.293
But, Mom!

00:04:28.369 --> 00:04:32.066
- Wait for me!

00:04:37.178 --> 00:04:39.578
Everybody, watch your step.

00:04:39.647 --> 00:04:42.707
Chihiro, don't cling like that.
You'll make me trip.

00:05:14.048 --> 00:05:16.039
What is this place?

00:05:16.117 --> 00:05:19.951
- Oh, do you hear that?

00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:30.053
- It sounds like a train.
- We must be near a train station.

00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:32.429
Come on. Let's go check it out.

00:06:08.236 --> 00:06:12.195
- What are those weird buildings?
- I knew it.

00:06:12.273 --> 00:06:16.004
It's an abandoned theme park. See?

00:06:16.077 --> 00:06:19.672
They built them
everywhere in the early '90s.

00:06:19.747 --> 00:06:23.649
Then the economy went bad,
and they all went bankrupt.

00:06:23.718 --> 00:06:25.618
This must be one of them.

00:06:25.687 --> 00:06:28.679
Where are you going?
You said just a quick look.

00:06:28.756 --> 00:06:31.384
Now let's go back.

00:06:33.528 --> 00:06:35.723
Hey!

00:06:44.739 --> 00:06:47.207
Did you hear that building?
It was moaning.

00:06:47.275 --> 00:06:49.209
It's just the wind.

00:06:49.277 --> 00:06:51.177
Oh, what a beautiful place.

00:06:51.245 --> 00:06:54.180
We should have brought our lunch.
We could have had a picnic.

00:06:56.551 --> 00:06:59.213
Look. They were planning
to put a river here.

00:07:00.288 --> 00:07:03.155
Hmm?

00:07:03.224 --> 00:07:07.092
- Hey, you smell that?

00:07:07.161 --> 00:07:10.028
- Something smells delicious.
- Yeah, and I'm starving.

00:07:10.098 --> 00:07:12.965
Maybe this theme park's
still in business. Let's go.

00:07:13.034 --> 00:07:14.968
Chihiro, hurry it up.

00:07:15.036 --> 00:07:17.027
Wait a minute.

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:35.514
Hmm.

00:07:38.693 --> 00:07:40.684
Over there.

00:07:50.004 --> 00:07:51.995
This way.

00:07:56.444 --> 00:07:59.242
How strange.
They're all restaurants.

00:07:59.313 --> 00:08:01.577
Where is everybody?

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.719
Ah, there it is.

00:08:09.791 --> 00:08:12.760
Hey, I found it!

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.830
Hey, you gotta see this. In here.

00:08:27.208 --> 00:08:29.233
Ahh, look at this.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.609
Hello in there!
Does anybody work here?

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.444
- Come in, Chihiro. It looks delicious.
- Mm-mmm.

00:08:35.516 --> 00:08:37.507
Anybody?

00:08:41.122 --> 00:08:44.558
Don't worry, honey. We can pay the bill
when they get back.

00:08:44.625 --> 00:08:47.025
Good plan. Hey, that looks great.

00:08:47.094 --> 00:08:51.030
I wonder what this is called.

00:08:51.098 --> 00:08:54.261
Oh, it's delicious. Chihiro,
you have to taste this.

00:08:54.335 --> 00:08:58.897
I don't want any. We're gonna get
in trouble. Let's just get out of here.

00:08:58.973 --> 00:09:01.942
Don't worry.
You've got Daddy here.

00:09:02.009 --> 00:09:04.671
He's got credit cards and cash.

00:09:04.745 --> 00:09:06.736
Mmm.

00:09:08.616 --> 00:09:12.950
- Chihiro, you have to
try this. It's so tender.
- Mm-mmm.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.011
- Mustard?
- Thank you.

00:09:16.858 --> 00:09:19.850
- Mmm.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.300
Come on, you guys. You can't.

00:10:37.371 --> 00:10:39.271
That's weird.

00:10:49.483 --> 00:10:51.883
It's a bathhouse.

00:11:09.103 --> 00:11:11.765
There's the train.

00:11:19.981 --> 00:11:23.314
- You shouldn't be here.
Get out of here now!

00:11:23.384 --> 00:11:25.318
- What?
- It's almost night.

00:11:25.386 --> 00:11:27.320
Leave, before it gets dark.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:32.184
They're lighting the lamps.
Get out of here.

00:11:32.259 --> 00:11:35.820
You've gotta get across the river. Go!
I'll distract them.

00:11:48.909 --> 00:11:51.343
What's up with him?

00:11:58.919 --> 00:12:00.853
Mom! Dad!

00:12:00.921 --> 00:12:05.415
Come on! Quit eating.
Let's get out of here!

00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:36.253
Mom! Dad! Where are you?

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:45.797
Mommy!

00:13:08.355 --> 00:13:10.152
Water?

00:13:22.603 --> 00:13:24.628
What?

00:13:24.705 --> 00:13:26.900
I'm dreaming!
I'm dreaming!

00:13:28.743 --> 00:13:31.177
Come on. Wake up! Wake up!

00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:35.009
Wake up.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.113
It's just a dream.
It's just a dream. Go away.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:46.182
Away. Disappear.

00:13:54.034 --> 00:13:58.027
I'm see-through!

00:13:58.105 --> 00:14:01.074
It's just a bad dream.

00:14:33.741 --> 00:14:36.175
- Oh!

00:14:40.581 --> 00:14:44.073
You're thriving. Ah, yes.

00:14:44.151 --> 00:14:47.348
- Looking forward to a relaxing time.
- Quite a long journey.

00:14:47.421 --> 00:14:51.380
- I hope they have...

00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:56.695
Don't be afraid.
I just want to help you.

00:14:56.764 --> 00:14:58.823
No! No! No!

00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:00.992
Open your mouth and eat this.

00:15:01.068 --> 00:15:04.731
You have to eat some food from
this world, or else you'll disappear.

00:15:04.805 --> 00:15:06.500
No!

00:15:09.543 --> 00:15:12.239
Don't worry.
It won't turn you into a pig.

00:15:12.313 --> 00:15:15.749
- Chew it and swallow.

00:15:24.725 --> 00:15:27.057
There you go. You're all better.

00:15:27.127 --> 00:15:29.118
See for yourself.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:39.300
- I'm okay.
- You see?

00:15:39.373 --> 00:15:42.069
- Now, come with me.
- Where are my mom and dad?

00:15:42.142 --> 00:15:44.440
They... didn't really
turn into pigs, did they?

00:15:44.511 --> 00:15:47.173
You can't see them now,
but you will.

00:15:48.549 --> 00:15:51.416
- Don't move.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:13.868
That bird's looking for you.
You've gotta get out of here.

00:16:13.941 --> 00:16:16.569
My legs! I can't stand up.

00:16:16.644 --> 00:16:18.578
Help! What do I do?

00:16:18.646 --> 00:16:21.581
Calm down.
Take a deep breath.

00:16:23.651 --> 00:16:28.554
In the name of the wind
and water within thee, unbind her.

00:16:28.622 --> 00:16:31.318
- Get up.

00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:04.551
- Welcome. Welcome.

00:17:04.625 --> 00:17:08.356
Always nice to see you.
Welcome back.

00:17:08.429 --> 00:17:11.330
- Welcome. Welcome.

00:17:11.398 --> 00:17:15.459
You have to hold your breath
while we cross the bridge.

00:17:15.536 --> 00:17:20.872
Even the tiniest breath will break the
spell, and then everyone will see you.

00:17:20.941 --> 00:17:23.637
- Wonderful to see you.

00:17:23.711 --> 00:17:25.770
- Nice to see you.
- Welcome back.

00:17:25.846 --> 00:17:27.871
I'm scared.

00:17:27.948 --> 00:17:29.882
Now just stay calm.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:32.851
Welcome. Welcome.
Always nice to see you.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.388
Welcome back.
Welcome. Welcome.

00:17:35.456 --> 00:17:37.856
- I'm back from my mission.
- Ahh, welcome.

00:17:37.925 --> 00:17:39.859
Welcome back, Master Haku.

00:17:39.927 --> 00:17:42.794
- Take a deep breath.

00:17:42.863 --> 00:17:44.922
Hold it.

00:18:00.714 --> 00:18:02.944
Welcome. Welcome.

00:18:03.017 --> 00:18:05.815
Welcome back.
Good to see you.

00:18:05.886 --> 00:18:07.877
- Hang on. Almost there.

00:18:07.955 --> 00:18:10.389
Master Haku!

00:18:10.457 --> 00:18:12.789
Where have you been?

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.988
Wha... A human?

00:18:16.063 --> 00:18:18.122
Let's go!

00:18:27.408 --> 00:18:31.105
Huh? Huh? Huh?

00:18:34.681 --> 00:18:39.311
Master Haku!
Master Haku!

00:18:39.386 --> 00:18:42.184
Hurry. Boy, boy, boy,
it stinks up the place.

00:18:42.256 --> 00:18:45.054
- They know you're here.
- I'm sorry. I took a breath.

00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:47.150
No, Chihiro, you did very well.

00:18:47.227 --> 00:18:49.661
Listen carefully to
what I tell you to do.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.664
You can't stay here.
They'll find you...

00:18:51.732 --> 00:18:53.723
and you'll never get
to rescue your parents.

00:18:53.801 --> 00:18:55.792
I'll create a diversion
while you escape.

00:18:55.869 --> 00:18:58.099
No! Don't leave me.
I don't wanna be alone.

00:18:58.172 --> 00:19:01.630
You don't have any choice if you want
to help your parents.

00:19:01.708 --> 00:19:03.699
This is what you have to do.

00:19:03.777 --> 00:19:07.975
They did turn into pigs.
I wasn't dreaming.

00:19:08.048 --> 00:19:10.039
Don't worry.

00:19:10.117 --> 00:19:13.985
Now, when things quiet down,
go out through the back gate.

00:19:14.054 --> 00:19:17.353
Go all the way down the stairs
until you reach the boiler room...

00:19:17.424 --> 00:19:19.688
where they stoke the fires.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.820
There you'll find Kamajii,
the boiler man.

00:19:22.896 --> 00:19:25.160
Kamajii?

00:19:25.232 --> 00:19:27.894
Tell him you want to work here.

00:19:27.968 --> 00:19:30.459
Even if he refuses, you must insist.

00:19:30.537 --> 00:19:34.439
If you don't get a job,
Yubaba will turn you into an animal.

00:19:34.508 --> 00:19:36.442
Yubaba. Huh?

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:38.910
You'll see. She's the witch who
rules the bathhouse.

00:19:38.979 --> 00:19:42.176
Kamajii will try to turn you away
or trick you into leaving...

00:19:42.249 --> 00:19:44.183
but just keep asking for work.

00:19:44.251 --> 00:19:47.618
It'll be hard work,
but you'll be able to stay here.

00:19:47.688 --> 00:19:50.179
- Then, even Yubaba can't harm you.
- Mm-hmm.

00:19:50.257 --> 00:19:53.192
- Master Haku?
- Master Haku, where are you?

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:56.957
I have to go. Don't forget, Chihiro,
I'm your friend.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:58.930
How did you know
my name's Chihiro?

00:19:58.999 --> 00:20:01.433
I've known you
since you were very small.

00:20:01.502 --> 00:20:04.437
Good luck, and whatever you do,
don't make a sound.

00:20:04.505 --> 00:20:06.439
- Master Haku.

00:20:06.507 --> 00:20:08.498
Calm down. I'm coming.

00:20:10.544 --> 00:20:12.671
Master Haku,
Yubaba wants to see you.

00:20:12.746 --> 00:20:16.773
I know. It's about
my mission, right?

00:20:27.594 --> 00:20:30.358
There's a human someplace.
We must find him.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:33.092
Let's go this way.

00:20:33.167 --> 00:20:36.102
Wait for me.
Wait for me. Wait.

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.195
Come on. Everything's fine.

00:24:24.097 --> 00:24:27.828
Uh, hello. Excuse me.

00:24:34.841 --> 00:24:37.537
Uh, hello?

00:24:43.049 --> 00:24:45.347
Uh, hello. Are you Kamajii?

00:24:45.419 --> 00:24:47.910
Eh?

00:24:47.988 --> 00:24:50.752
Huh?

00:24:50.824 --> 00:24:55.659
Haku told me to come here
and ask you for work.

00:24:55.729 --> 00:24:58.220
- Could you give me a job?

00:25:00.534 --> 00:25:05.096
Four bath tokens at once.

00:25:05.172 --> 00:25:07.538
- Come on. Get to work, you little runts.

00:25:07.607 --> 00:25:10.303
Yeah, I'm Kamajii...

00:25:10.377 --> 00:25:13.972
slave to the boiler
that heats the baths.

00:25:14.047 --> 00:25:16.811
Move it, ya stupid soot balls.

00:25:16.883 --> 00:25:19.477
Please, I've gotta get a job here.

00:25:19.553 --> 00:25:21.487
I don't need any help.

00:25:21.555 --> 00:25:25.184
The place is full of soot.
I just cast a spell on them...

00:25:25.258 --> 00:25:27.954
and I've got all
the workers I need.

00:25:41.007 --> 00:25:43.771
- Oh. Sorry.

00:25:46.646 --> 00:25:49.080
Wait. Just a second.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:03.120
- Out of the way.

00:26:55.615 --> 00:26:58.049
What should I do with this?

00:27:03.757 --> 00:27:06.157
Should I leave it here?

00:27:06.226 --> 00:27:08.694
Finish what you started, human.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.575
- Hmm?

00:28:08.355 --> 00:28:12.519
Hey, you runts. You wanna turn
back into soot?

00:28:12.592 --> 00:28:16.119
And you, back off. You can't just take
someone else's job.

00:28:16.196 --> 00:28:19.597
If they don't work, the spell wears off.
They turn back into soot.

00:28:19.666 --> 00:28:24.000
There's no work for you here, got it?
Try somewhere else.

00:28:31.678 --> 00:28:36.081
You soot balls got a problem?
Get back to work!

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:39.880
Chow time. What's going on?

00:28:39.953 --> 00:28:42.217
Are you guys fighting again?

00:28:42.288 --> 00:28:45.018
- Where's your other bowl?

00:28:45.091 --> 00:28:47.025
- Oh. Ahh.
- From yesterday?

00:28:47.093 --> 00:28:49.823
I keep telling you
to leave it out, Kamajii.

00:28:49.896 --> 00:28:51.921
Meal time! Take a break.

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:13.080
A human! You're in trouble.
You're the one everyone's looking for.

00:29:13.153 --> 00:29:15.781
- She's my granddaughter.
- Granddaughter?

00:29:17.357 --> 00:29:19.291
She said she wants to work here...

00:29:19.359 --> 00:29:21.486
but I've got all the help I need.

00:29:21.561 --> 00:29:24.826
Will you take her to see Yubaba?
She's a tough little girl.

00:29:24.898 --> 00:29:26.832
I think she can handle it.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.528
No way.
I'm not gonna risk my life.

00:29:29.602 --> 00:29:33.766
What if I give you
this roasted newt? Hmm?

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:36.104
It's a good one.

00:29:36.176 --> 00:29:40.203
If you want a job, you'll have to
make a deal with Yubaba.

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.680
She's the head honcho here.

00:29:42.749 --> 00:29:46.685
Give me that! Come on, little girl.
You better follow me.

00:29:52.726 --> 00:29:56.719
- Can't you even manage a
"Yes, ma'am" or a "Thank you"?
- Yes, ma'am.

00:29:56.796 --> 00:29:58.730
What a dope. Hurry up.

00:29:58.798 --> 00:30:01.062
- Yes, ma'am.

00:30:01.134 --> 00:30:03.932
You don't need
your shoes or your socks.

00:30:04.003 --> 00:30:05.937
- Just leave 'em.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:30:11.778 --> 00:30:16.374
Thank the boiler man, you idiot.
You know, he's really sticking
his neck out for you.

00:30:16.449 --> 00:30:20.180
Thank you, Mr. Boiler Man.

00:30:20.253 --> 00:30:23.017
Good luck.

00:30:31.331 --> 00:30:36.496
We have to go all the way to the
top floor. That's where Yubaba lives.

00:30:48.882 --> 00:30:51.646
Get over here.

00:30:55.989 --> 00:30:58.924
- You wanna lose your nose?

00:31:09.102 --> 00:31:12.094
More appetizers.

00:31:12.172 --> 00:31:14.106
Not spicy enough.

00:31:22.749 --> 00:31:25.343
- We're halfway there. Just stay close.
- Okay.

00:31:28.988 --> 00:31:31.354
Here we go.

00:31:33.626 --> 00:31:36.094
The radish spirit.

00:31:41.734 --> 00:31:43.759
Sorry, sir. This elevator
doesn't go any higher.

00:31:43.837 --> 00:31:47.238
You'll have to take
another one. Thank you.

00:32:08.995 --> 00:32:11.964
- He's following us.
- Just don't look at him.

00:32:27.146 --> 00:32:29.546
- Step out to the right,
please, gentlemen.

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:34.551
I don't think they're big enough.

00:32:34.621 --> 00:32:36.555
Your rooms are right this way.

00:32:38.091 --> 00:32:40.787
- Hmm. Rin?
- What?

00:32:42.962 --> 00:32:45.157
What's that smell?

00:32:45.231 --> 00:32:48.758
- It's human. You smell
just like a human.
- Oh, really?

00:32:48.835 --> 00:32:52.999
Where's it coming from, Rin?
Come on.

00:32:53.072 --> 00:32:56.473
You're hiding something, aren't you?

00:32:56.542 --> 00:32:59.511
- Show it to me.
- Is this what you smell?

00:32:59.579 --> 00:33:02.275
Roasted... newt!

00:33:02.348 --> 00:33:05.715
No way, frog.
I'm saving every last bite for myself.

00:33:05.785 --> 00:33:08.777
Please, just a little bit.
Just give me a leg.

00:33:08.855 --> 00:33:12.951
- If you wanna go up,
pull the lever on your right.

00:33:13.026 --> 00:33:17.861
Gimme, gimme, gimme.
How could you be so cruel?

00:33:17.931 --> 00:33:21.458
- Can't you share?

00:33:21.534 --> 00:33:24.469
Let me suck on the tail. Please!

00:33:24.537 --> 00:33:28.098
- Let me...
- Mmm.

00:34:58.264 --> 00:35:00.289
- Aren't you even going to knock?

00:35:00.366 --> 00:35:04.132
You're the most pathetic little girl
I've ever seen.

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:16.339
Well, come in.

00:35:19.419 --> 00:35:22.820
- I said, come in.

00:35:48.448 --> 00:35:51.611
Quiet down.
You're making a racket.

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:14.370
Excuse me. I was wondering
if you could give me a job?

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:25.576
I don't want to hear
such a stupid request.

00:36:25.651 --> 00:36:29.314
You're just a stinking,
useless weakling.

00:36:29.388 --> 00:36:34.655
And this is certainly
no place for humans.

00:36:34.727 --> 00:36:37.924
It's a bathhouse for the spirits.

00:36:37.997 --> 00:36:41.694
It's where they come
to replenish themselves.

00:36:41.767 --> 00:36:45.168
And you humans
always make a mess of things.

00:36:45.238 --> 00:36:50.175
Like your parents, who gobbled up
the food of the spirits like pigs.

00:36:50.243 --> 00:36:54.543
They got what they deserved,
and you should be punished too.

00:36:54.614 --> 00:37:00.519
Hmm.

00:37:00.586 --> 00:37:02.577
You could be a piglet.

00:37:02.655 --> 00:37:06.955
Or, maybe you'd prefer
a lump of coal?

00:37:15.034 --> 00:37:19.471
I can see you shaking. Actually,
I'm impressed you made it this far.

00:37:19.539 --> 00:37:23.498
But I'm sure
you didn't do it on your own.

00:37:23.576 --> 00:37:26.374
Let's thank whoever helped you.

00:37:26.445 --> 00:37:30.609
Just who was it, dear?
Why don't you tell me.

00:37:30.683 --> 00:37:35.143
- Please! Can't you give me a job?

00:37:35.221 --> 00:37:38.349
- Don't start that again.
- Please, I just want to work.

00:37:38.424 --> 00:37:42.622
Don't say that!

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:51.295
Why in world do you think
I should give you a job?

00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:54.737
Anyone can see you're
a lazy, spoiled crybaby...

00:37:54.807 --> 00:37:57.367
and you have no manners.

00:37:57.443 --> 00:38:00.674
This is a high-class place
I'm running here.

00:38:00.746 --> 00:38:06.685
So there's no job for you.
Now get out. I've got
all the lazy bums I need.

00:38:06.752 --> 00:38:12.520
- Or maybe I'll give you the most
difficult job I've got...

00:38:12.592 --> 00:38:15.026
and work you until you breathe...

00:38:15.094 --> 00:38:19.622
your very last breath.

00:38:31.577 --> 00:38:34.842
Oh, dear,
you woke up the baby.

00:38:34.914 --> 00:38:38.645
Mommy's here.
Be a good boy now.

00:38:38.718 --> 00:38:41.380
Why are you still here?
I told you to leave.

00:38:41.454 --> 00:38:43.422
I want you to give me a job, please!

00:38:43.489 --> 00:38:46.083
Quiet down! You're scaring the baby.

00:38:46.158 --> 00:38:49.855
- Ooh! Hi, sweetie. Don't be angry.

00:38:49.929 --> 00:38:54.389
- That's a good boy.

00:38:54.467 --> 00:38:56.799
I'm not leaving
till you give me a job.

00:38:56.869 --> 00:38:59.303
- Okay. Okay. Just be quiet.

00:38:59.372 --> 00:39:04.241
Here comes Mommy.
I'm coming to get you.

00:39:24.764 --> 00:39:26.732
That's your contract.

00:39:26.799 --> 00:39:32.396
Sign your name away,
and I'll put you to work.

00:39:32.471 --> 00:39:34.496
If I hear one little
complaint out of you...

00:39:34.573 --> 00:39:37.770
you'll be joining
your parents in the pigpen.

00:39:37.843 --> 00:39:40.243
So I...
Do I sign my name here?

00:39:40.313 --> 00:39:43.714
Just sign it.
Do you want the job or not?

00:39:48.854 --> 00:39:51.049
- I can't believe I took that oath.

00:39:51.123 --> 00:39:54.115
Give a job to anyone who asks.

00:39:55.728 --> 00:40:00.256
Ridiculous. I hate being
so nice all the time. Ha!

00:40:00.333 --> 00:40:02.893
Are you done yet?

00:40:06.906 --> 00:40:10.467
- So, your name's Chihiro.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:40:10.543 --> 00:40:13.341
What a pretty name.

00:40:22.488 --> 00:40:25.651
And it belongs to me now.

00:40:25.725 --> 00:40:28.751
From now on, your name is Sen.
You got that?

00:40:28.828 --> 00:40:31.626
- Answer me, Sen!
- Yes, ma'am.

00:40:31.697 --> 00:40:36.464
You called for me?

00:40:36.535 --> 00:40:39.936
This girl signed a contract.
Set her up with a job.

00:40:40.005 --> 00:40:42.838
Right. What's your name?

00:40:42.908 --> 00:40:46.571
What? Chih... Oh. It's Sen.

00:40:46.645 --> 00:40:49.045
Okay, Sen. Follow me.

00:40:56.722 --> 00:40:58.883
Haku, uh...

00:40:58.958 --> 00:41:03.156
Don't talk to me,
and address me as Master Haku.

00:41:18.611 --> 00:41:24.072
- I don't care if Yubaba
gets angry with us.
- We're not taking humans.

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:26.550
- She's already under contract.
- What?

00:41:26.619 --> 00:41:30.817
- I promise to work very hard.
- We are not gonna
take her in our department.

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:32.915
- She'll stink up the whole place.
- We don't want her.

00:41:32.992 --> 00:41:36.189
Three days of eating our food,
and her smell will go away.

00:41:36.262 --> 00:41:41.598
If she doesn't work hard, roast her,
boil her, do whatever you want.

00:41:41.667 --> 00:41:44.192
Now get back to work.
Where is Rin?

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:46.704
What? Don't you dump her on me.

00:41:46.772 --> 00:41:49.605
- You said you wanted an assistant.
- That's perfect.

00:41:49.675 --> 00:41:51.870
- Give the girl to Rin.
- Oh, great.

00:41:51.944 --> 00:41:54.777
- Sen, get going.
- Right.

00:41:54.847 --> 00:41:58.283
Why are you picking on me?
You owe me one, Haku. You hear me?

00:41:58.350 --> 00:42:02.116
- Have a nice day.
- Hmph.

00:42:02.188 --> 00:42:04.452
Come on.

00:42:12.465 --> 00:42:14.456
I can't believe you pulled it off.

00:42:14.533 --> 00:42:17.229
- Huh?
- You're such a dope.
I was really worried.

00:42:17.303 --> 00:42:22.036
Now, keep on your toes,
and if you need anything, ask me. Okay?

00:42:22.107 --> 00:42:24.735
- Okay.
- Hmm? What's wrong?

00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:27.745
I don't feel so good.

00:42:31.951 --> 00:42:34.943
So, this is our room.

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:37.614
A little food and some sleep
and you'll be fine.

00:42:39.959 --> 00:42:43.918
Here's your apron. You have to
wash it yourself. Your pants.

00:42:43.996 --> 00:42:47.796
You're so puny.

00:42:47.867 --> 00:42:49.960
Way too big.

00:42:50.035 --> 00:42:53.630
- Rin, you know Haku?
- What about him?

00:42:53.706 --> 00:42:55.970
There aren't two of him
here, are there?

00:42:56.041 --> 00:43:00.842
Two Hakus?
I can barely stand one. Too big.

00:43:00.913 --> 00:43:04.144
He's Yubaba's henchman.
Don't trust anything he says.

00:43:07.486 --> 00:43:10.182
- Let's see.

00:43:10.256 --> 00:43:15.660
Ah, here we go.
Wh-What's wrong with you?

00:43:15.728 --> 00:43:18.856
Are you feeling okay?

00:43:18.931 --> 00:43:20.956
Quiet down. What's your problem?

00:43:21.033 --> 00:43:24.264
It's the new girl.
She doesn't feel so good.

00:44:55.861 --> 00:44:59.456
Meet me at the bridge.
I'll take you to your parents.

00:45:44.209 --> 00:45:49.203
- My shoes are gone.

00:45:51.483 --> 00:45:54.008
- Huh?

00:45:59.625 --> 00:46:01.616
Thank you.

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.655
- Follow me.

00:47:20.439 --> 00:47:25.035
We don't have much time.
If you're found here, you'll be
turned into a pig yourself.

00:47:27.012 --> 00:47:31.574
- You must never come here
without me. Understand?

00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:34.050
I understand.

00:47:54.206 --> 00:47:58.768
Mom, Dad, are you all right?
It's me, Sen. Hey, wake up!

00:47:58.844 --> 00:48:01.244
Mom! Dad!

00:48:04.983 --> 00:48:07.247
What's wrong with them?
Are they sick?

00:48:07.319 --> 00:48:09.810
No. They ate too much.
They're sleeping it off.

00:48:09.888 --> 00:48:12.288
They don't remember
being human.

00:48:12.357 --> 00:48:14.791
So look hard. It's up to you
to remember which ones they are.

00:48:19.164 --> 00:48:21.155
Don't you worry, I promise
I'll get you out of here.

00:48:21.233 --> 00:48:25.033
So just don't get any fatter
or they'll eat you!

00:48:32.411 --> 00:48:35.209
Here are your clothes. Hide them.

00:48:37.549 --> 00:48:42.145
- I thought they'd been thrown away.
- You'll need them to get home.

00:48:47.259 --> 00:48:50.160
My good-bye card's still here.

00:48:52.731 --> 00:48:57.191
Chihiro. Chihiro.
That's my name, isn't it?

00:48:57.269 --> 00:48:59.669
That's how Yubaba controls you...
by stealing your name.

00:48:59.738 --> 00:49:01.968
So hold on to that card.
Keep it hidden.

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:04.941
While you're here,
you must call yourself Sen.

00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:08.002
I can't believe I forgot my name.
She almost took it from me.

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:12.881
If you completely forget it,
you'll never find your way home.

00:49:12.951 --> 00:49:15.476
I've tried everything
to remember mine.

00:49:15.554 --> 00:49:17.488
You can't remember your name?

00:49:17.556 --> 00:49:20.957
No. But for some reason,
I remember yours.

00:49:23.061 --> 00:49:26.462
Here you go. Eat this.
You must be hungry.

00:49:26.531 --> 00:49:30.524
- No.
- I put a spell on it so it'll
give you back your strength.

00:49:30.602 --> 00:49:33.162
Just eat it.

00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:11.040
Have some more. You'll be all right.

00:50:22.354 --> 00:50:25.346
I've got to go now.
I'll be back to help you soon.

00:50:25.424 --> 00:50:30.020
- Just stay out of trouble.
- Thank you, Haku. You're a good friend.

00:50:44.242 --> 00:50:46.233
Haku.

00:50:49.348 --> 00:50:52.340
He's a dragon?

00:51:17.109 --> 00:51:18.974
Huh?

00:52:04.823 --> 00:52:08.850
- Where were you, Sen?
I was really worried.
- I'm sorry.

00:52:18.136 --> 00:52:20.001
- Out of my way.

00:52:29.581 --> 00:52:32.516
- Gee, Sen...

00:52:32.584 --> 00:52:35.576
haven't you ever worked
a day in your life?

00:52:35.654 --> 00:52:38.145
- Rin and Sen, you get the big tub today.
- What?

00:52:38.223 --> 00:52:42.421
- Hey, that's frog work.
- Orders from the top.
So quit your complaining.

00:53:03.081 --> 00:53:05.675
Hello. Aren't you
getting wet out there?

00:53:09.788 --> 00:53:12.780
- Sen, hurry up.
- Coming.

00:53:12.858 --> 00:53:15.452
I'll leave the door open for you.

00:53:42.521 --> 00:53:44.580
- Heard you got the big tub, Rin.
- Leave me alone.

00:53:48.293 --> 00:53:51.126
Those jerks. They haven't cleaned
this tub in months.

00:54:03.241 --> 00:54:06.972
We only use this tub
for our really filthy guests.

00:54:07.045 --> 00:54:10.981
Disgusting. This sludge is so caked on,
it'll take days to scrub off.

00:54:11.049 --> 00:54:13.745
Rin, Sen, you've got
some customers on the way.

00:54:13.818 --> 00:54:17.219
Wait! Give us a minute.
This is clearly harassment.

00:54:17.289 --> 00:54:22.317
We'll have to soak it off. Get an herbal
soak token from the foreman.

00:54:22.394 --> 00:54:25.090
A what?

00:54:25.163 --> 00:54:29.190
- An herbal soak token.
- All right.

00:54:29.267 --> 00:54:31.292
Hey, Rin, what's a foreman?

00:54:33.872 --> 00:54:37.831
Hmm. Something's coming.
I wonder what?

00:54:46.651 --> 00:54:51.850
What useless scum
is sleeking around in the rain?

00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:19.917
I can't waste a token on you.
Relax. Good morning.

00:55:19.985 --> 00:55:22.249
Enjoy. Have a nice bath.

00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:25.949
- For the radish spirit.
- One sulfur soak.

00:55:26.024 --> 00:55:28.993
Why are you still standing here?
Scrub it yourself.

00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:32.860
I'm not giving you a token.
Relax. Good morning.

00:55:32.931 --> 00:55:37.459
- I said scrub it yourself.
- But I was told it has
to have an herbal soak.

00:55:37.535 --> 00:55:43.474
Well, that's too bad. Mugwort bath?
Relax and enjoy it.

00:55:49.547 --> 00:55:52.345
- Hmm?

00:55:52.417 --> 00:55:55.875
Foreman speaking. Oh, yes. What?

00:55:55.954 --> 00:55:59.754
- Thank you very much.
- Get back here!

00:55:59.824 --> 00:56:02.019
- Hey! Wait a minute.
- What's going on?

00:56:02.093 --> 00:56:05.153
- Nothing. Everything's fine.
- We have an intruder.

00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:09.860
- Is it a human?
- I'm not quite sure.
Figure it out and report back.

00:56:09.934 --> 00:56:12.494
Wow, Sen. You got a really good one.

00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:16.301
Clip this on, then let go.

00:56:16.374 --> 00:56:19.537
It goes straight to Kamajii,
then he sends us our water.

00:56:24.316 --> 00:56:27.308
You pull on this to start
the water flowing. Give it a try.

00:56:36.227 --> 00:56:40.220
- Uh, you're such a klutz.
- Yuck! What's in this water?

00:56:40.298 --> 00:56:43.131
Dried worm salt.
It's supposed to be good for you.

00:56:43.201 --> 00:56:47.661
And with water this murky,
you can't see all the sludge in the tub.

00:56:47.739 --> 00:56:51.505
Yank it again when the bath
is full, it'll stop.

00:56:51.576 --> 00:56:55.171
You can let go of the rope now.
I'll get us some breakfast.

00:56:55.246 --> 00:56:57.237
Okay.

00:57:17.769 --> 00:57:20.363
Ow!

00:57:25.276 --> 00:57:28.006
Uh, sir.
The bath's not ready yet.

00:57:31.483 --> 00:57:36.284
- There's so many.

00:57:37.889 --> 00:57:42.553
- What? They're all for me?
- Uh... Uh...

00:57:42.627 --> 00:57:45.152
Thanks, but I don't need any more.

00:57:47.332 --> 00:57:49.698
- Uh...
- No. I only need one.

00:58:04.716 --> 00:58:06.741
- Oh, Yubaba.
- It's a stink spirit.

00:58:06.818 --> 00:58:11.187
- And apparently,
it's an extra smelly one.
- He's headed for the bridge.

00:58:13.725 --> 00:58:17.684
We're closed.
Go away. We're not open.

00:58:17.762 --> 00:58:20.356
- Go! Please, go. Leave us.
- There's no one here.

00:58:23.234 --> 00:58:27.466
Hmm. Something's fishy.
That doesn't seem like
a stink spirit to me.

00:58:27.539 --> 00:58:29.939
But we have no choice.
Go greet him.

00:58:30.008 --> 00:58:34.445
Just give him a bath and get him
out of here as fast as you can.

00:58:34.512 --> 00:58:38.448
Everybody go back to your rooms.
Back to your rooms.

00:58:38.516 --> 00:58:42.509
- Don't worry about a thing.
Everybody just be calm.
- Sen, Yubaba wants to see you.

00:58:42.587 --> 00:58:45.784
- Yes, sir.
- Sen, don't mess this up.

00:58:45.857 --> 00:58:49.190
Take this guest to the big tub
and take care of him.

00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:52.195
- But-But, I...
- No buts, or I'll turn you into coal.

00:58:52.263 --> 00:58:55.323
- You hear me?
- It's here.

00:59:05.076 --> 00:59:07.806
Hands down. You'll insult our guest.

00:59:15.587 --> 00:59:20.047
Look about you, customer.
Welcome to our baths.

00:59:22.093 --> 00:59:24.891
Oh, it's money.

00:59:24.963 --> 00:59:28.956
- Sen, take the nice customer's money.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:59:37.375 --> 00:59:41.971
Don't make him wait.
Get him to the bath.

00:59:42.046 --> 00:59:44.514
This way.

00:59:59.731 --> 01:00:03.326
- Get out of my way!
- Sen!

01:00:10.475 --> 01:00:12.409
Our food!

01:00:12.477 --> 01:00:14.604
Open your windows, all of them!

01:00:14.679 --> 01:00:16.579
Quickly!

01:00:57.789 --> 01:01:00.189
What? Just a minute, sir.

01:01:04.696 --> 01:01:07.392
Disgusting?

01:01:07.465 --> 01:01:10.593
- I don't think it's very funny.
- Let's see what she'll do next.

01:01:15.073 --> 01:01:17.541
Look. She wants to refill the tub.

01:01:17.609 --> 01:01:20.601
Oh, dear! She's gonna waste
all our good water!

01:01:22.947 --> 01:01:25.507
Ow!

01:01:32.824 --> 01:01:35.384
Hmm. Who gave her
all the bath tokens?

01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:37.394
Don't look at me. I didn't do it.

01:02:19.871 --> 01:02:22.362
Oh, no! That's our best
herbal formula!

01:02:48.299 --> 01:02:50.358
Sen! Sen, where are you?

01:02:50.435 --> 01:02:52.835
Over here!

01:02:52.904 --> 01:02:55.873
Don't worry.
St-Stay right where you are.
I'm coming to help you.

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:58.465
You're gonna be fine.
I won't let him hurt you.

01:02:58.543 --> 01:03:02.309
I think he needs help. It feels like
there's a thorn in his side.

01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:05.008
- A thorn?
- It won't come out!

01:03:05.083 --> 01:03:08.985
What's that?
He has a thorn? Hmm.

01:03:09.053 --> 01:03:11.920
- Get the staff down there. Step on it!
- Huh?

01:03:11.989 --> 01:03:15.015
Right, right, right!
Get downstairs! Help her! You!

01:03:15.093 --> 01:03:17.061
- All of you!
- Listen to me.

01:03:17.128 --> 01:03:19.528
That's no stink spirit
we have on our hands...

01:03:21.966 --> 01:03:24.161
- Grab onto this rope.
- Wait!

01:03:32.944 --> 01:03:35.879
- Mmm. Hold on tight.
- Got it.

01:03:35.947 --> 01:03:37.847
- Hurry up, now.
- Get in there!

01:03:37.915 --> 01:03:39.849
Everyone get in there
and help them.

01:03:39.917 --> 01:03:41.817
We've got it tied on!

01:03:43.321 --> 01:03:46.722
Everyone, ready on my command.

01:03:46.791 --> 01:03:49.351
And... heave!

01:03:49.427 --> 01:03:51.861
And... heave!

01:03:51.929 --> 01:03:54.363
- Heave!
- And...

01:03:54.432 --> 01:03:56.866
- heave!
- Heave!

01:03:56.934 --> 01:03:59.368
And heave!

01:03:59.437 --> 01:04:03.373
And heave!

01:04:03.441 --> 01:04:05.466
A bicycle?

01:04:05.543 --> 01:04:07.477
Thought so.

01:04:07.545 --> 01:04:09.479
Get ready, now!

01:04:09.547 --> 01:04:12.573
- Heave!
- Heave!

01:04:12.650 --> 01:04:14.675
Heave!

01:04:43.714 --> 01:04:46.342
Sen! Sen, where are you?

01:04:56.694 --> 01:04:59.219
Well done.

01:05:04.535 --> 01:05:06.526
Huh?

01:05:17.715 --> 01:05:20.582
Ahh!

01:05:28.759 --> 01:05:31.353
- Gold!
- Gold!

01:05:31.429 --> 01:05:33.659
Hey, wait!
That's company property!

01:05:33.731 --> 01:05:35.665
- Stop!
- Back off!

01:05:35.733 --> 01:05:38.429
- Our guest is still here, you idiots!

01:05:43.341 --> 01:05:46.037
Sen, you're in our guest's way.
Step aside.

01:05:46.110 --> 01:05:48.738
- Yes, ma'am.
- Open the main gates! Make way!

01:06:15.306 --> 01:06:20.471
Sen, you did great!
We made so much money!

01:06:20.544 --> 01:06:24.742
That spirit is rich and powerful.
Everyone, learn from Sen.

01:06:24.815 --> 01:06:27.784
- Sake's on the house tonight.

01:06:27.852 --> 01:06:31.253
- But first, hand over
all the gold you picked up.

01:06:31.322 --> 01:06:34.723
- That's not fair!
- How stingy! That's no fair!

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.230
Here.

01:06:45.303 --> 01:06:48.795
- I swiped a dumpling for you.
- Thank you.

01:06:48.873 --> 01:06:51.364
What a day. Mmm.

01:06:52.977 --> 01:06:56.208
- Rin, have you seen Haku?
- Not Haku again.

01:06:57.548 --> 01:06:59.516
He just disappears sometimes.

01:06:59.583 --> 01:07:03.485
Rumor has it he runs around
doing Yubaba's dirty work.

01:07:03.554 --> 01:07:06.421
- Does he really?
- Lights out, Rin.

01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:08.390
Fine.

01:07:32.616 --> 01:07:35.244
There's so much water.
It looks like a sea.

01:07:35.319 --> 01:07:38.345
What'd you expect
after all that rain?

01:07:40.458 --> 01:07:44.758
I've gotta get out of this place.
Someday, I'm getting on that train.

01:07:55.373 --> 01:07:57.864
Mmm.

01:08:07.118 --> 01:08:09.552
- What's wrong?

01:08:28.839 --> 01:08:30.773
Ah!

01:08:33.878 --> 01:08:35.903
Hmm.
Uh-uh.

01:08:37.648 --> 01:08:39.980
Huh?
Ahh!

01:08:40.051 --> 01:08:42.349
It's gold! Huh?

01:08:44.088 --> 01:08:46.386
What do you think you're doing?
You're not allowed in there.

01:08:46.457 --> 01:08:48.823
The bath's closed.
Get out, you! Get out of there!

01:08:53.798 --> 01:08:56.631
Ooh! Oh! More gold!

01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:58.600
Are you... Are you...
Are you giving them to me?

01:09:03.741 --> 01:09:06.301
Wait. You can make gold?

01:09:08.846 --> 01:09:10.837
Ahh.

01:09:10.915 --> 01:09:12.849
Uh, gimme!

01:09:14.518 --> 01:09:16.918
Ahh.

01:09:20.291 --> 01:09:22.725
What's going on in there?

01:09:23.894 --> 01:09:26.021
It's way past bedtime. Come on!

01:09:26.097 --> 01:09:29.032
-Wh...

01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:32.968
Hey, boss, up here.
I'm hungry. Starving!

01:09:33.037 --> 01:09:35.267
- And I want you to serve me.
- I know that voice.

01:09:35.339 --> 01:09:37.239
Here, I'll pay you up front.

01:09:37.308 --> 01:09:40.175
And... I wanna take a bath too.

01:09:40.244 --> 01:09:42.371
Why don't you wake everyone up?

01:09:48.018 --> 01:09:50.714
Mom, Dad, I got a gift
from the river spirit!

01:09:50.788 --> 01:09:53.484
Maybe if you eat it,
it'll break the spell.

01:09:58.295 --> 01:10:00.889
Which ones are you?

01:10:00.965 --> 01:10:03.058
Mom, Dad!

01:10:11.642 --> 01:10:14.202
Bad dream.

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:18.212
Rin?

01:10:21.118 --> 01:10:23.052
Where is everybody?

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.590
Wow. It really is a sea.

01:10:32.796 --> 01:10:35.287
There's Mom and Dad's pigpen.

01:10:36.767 --> 01:10:39.861
I sure hope they're doing
all right over there.

01:10:43.707 --> 01:10:46.267
Kamajii lit the boiler already?

01:10:46.343 --> 01:10:49.141
How long was I asleep?

01:10:49.213 --> 01:10:51.613
- Hurry up!

01:10:51.682 --> 01:10:54.617
Come on, he's starving!
Can't you cook any faster?

01:10:54.685 --> 01:10:58.712
Serve everything you've got,
even leftovers if you have to.
Hurry up! He's starving!

01:11:00.724 --> 01:11:03.158
- Hey, Sen.
- Oh, Rin.

01:11:03.227 --> 01:11:05.821
I was just coming
to wake you up. Look.

01:11:05.896 --> 01:11:09.297
It's real gold.
There's a new guest here who's loaded.

01:11:09.366 --> 01:11:11.800
He's giving gold away
by the handfuls!

01:11:22.279 --> 01:11:25.874
Just keep the food coming.
I wanna eat everything!

01:11:28.719 --> 01:11:31.187
Hmm. Who is the guest?

01:11:31.255 --> 01:11:35.191
Oh, who cares? Come on,
before Yubaba wakes up.

01:11:35.259 --> 01:11:37.193
I'm going to go look for Haku.

01:11:37.261 --> 01:11:40.287
Oh! Would you quit
worrying about Haku?

01:11:40.364 --> 01:11:42.628
- Come on, Sen. Let's go get some gold.
- Come on, Rin!

01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:44.861
- Let's go get some more!
- You bet!

01:11:44.935 --> 01:11:46.835
Hey, wait for me!

01:12:04.188 --> 01:12:07.646
Where is Haku?

01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:13.419
He better get here before I forget
what my parents look like.

01:12:13.497 --> 01:12:16.193
I sure hope Dad hasn't gotten too fat.

01:12:29.079 --> 01:12:31.445
Hmm?

01:12:34.785 --> 01:12:36.685
Haku?

01:12:44.361 --> 01:12:47.125
It's Haku! He's back!

01:12:50.768 --> 01:12:53.202
Are birds chasing him?

01:13:03.647 --> 01:13:06.775
Haku! Fight 'em! Come on!

01:13:06.850 --> 01:13:09.546
He's hurt!

01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:12.612
Haku, this way!

01:13:12.690 --> 01:13:14.317
Aah!

01:13:27.571 --> 01:13:29.971
Huh? It's just paper.

01:13:58.435 --> 01:14:00.767
Haku, you're bleeding.

01:14:06.443 --> 01:14:11.380
Hold still.
Those paper things are gone now.
You're going to be all right.

01:14:24.328 --> 01:14:29.288
He went in that top window.
I've got to get there
before he bleeds to death!

01:14:36.874 --> 01:14:40.401
# Welcome the rich man
He's hard for you to miss #

01:14:40.477 --> 01:14:43.776
# His butt keeps getting bigger
so there's plenty there to kiss #

01:14:43.847 --> 01:14:47.408
Oh, hey, everybody, bow down.

01:14:47.484 --> 01:14:49.418
Welcome, rich man.

01:14:49.486 --> 01:14:53.183
# Beg for tips
This is the time #

01:14:53.257 --> 01:14:55.953
- # Beg for tips
Make yourselves a dime #

01:14:57.561 --> 01:15:01.395
Give me some dough!
Give me some tips!

01:15:01.465 --> 01:15:05.595
I'll do anything for you!
Just give me some tips!

01:15:08.105 --> 01:15:10.972
- Hey, what are you doing?

01:15:11.041 --> 01:15:14.169
- Going upstairs.
- No, you're not.

01:15:14.244 --> 01:15:15.939
Huh? Aah! Blood!

01:15:19.683 --> 01:15:22.117
Get out of the way!
Our guest is coming through here!

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:25.711
Thank you for helping me earlier.

01:15:25.789 --> 01:15:28.758
- Don't talk to him, you stinking hum...
- Hey!

01:15:49.213 --> 01:15:51.841
I don't want any, but thanks.

01:15:54.551 --> 01:15:57.486
I'm sorry,
but I'm in a really big hurry.

01:16:08.899 --> 01:16:11.697
- Hey, there! Hey!
Get back! Get back now!
- Ow!

01:16:11.768 --> 01:16:14.566
Everybody, out!

01:16:14.638 --> 01:16:16.572
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, sir.

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:19.905
You'll have to excuse the little girl.
She's just a human.

01:16:23.013 --> 01:16:25.174
- Wipe that smile off your face.
- What?

01:16:25.249 --> 01:16:27.308
- You're still smiling.
- No, I'm not.

01:17:21.004 --> 01:17:22.904
Aah!

01:17:53.804 --> 01:17:55.704
Huh?

01:18:00.844 --> 01:18:02.744
It's Yubaba!

01:19:15.085 --> 01:19:17.246
We're in a big mess.

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:19.788
I found out who
our rich customer is.

01:19:19.856 --> 01:19:22.723
He's a No-Face!
It's all your fault. You're so greedy.

01:19:22.793 --> 01:19:26.923
You attract terrible guests.
All right, I'm on my way.

01:19:26.997 --> 01:19:30.455
Don't let him eat anyone else
till I get down there.

01:19:30.534 --> 01:19:33.992
Haku is bleeding
all over the carpet.

01:19:34.071 --> 01:19:37.006
Get him out of here.
He'll be dead soon anyway.

01:19:54.858 --> 01:19:57.156
- Ahh.

01:19:59.129 --> 01:20:02.530
Hi, sweetie.
Hiding under the cushions again?

01:20:06.236 --> 01:20:10.570
Oh, I woke you,
and you were sound asleep.

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:13.609
I'm sorry.
Let me give you a kiss.

01:20:16.546 --> 01:20:18.446
Go back to sleep, now.

01:20:47.944 --> 01:20:49.935
Ow! Let go of me!

01:20:50.013 --> 01:20:53.574
Wow, you're a big baby.
Would you mind letting go of me?

01:20:53.650 --> 01:20:57.381
- I'm in a really big hurry.
- You came in here to make me sick.

01:20:57.454 --> 01:21:00.617
- Huh?
- You're a bad germ from
outside, aren't you?

01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:03.386
I'm not a germ, I'm a human.

01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:05.394
Now, would you please let go of me?

01:21:05.462 --> 01:21:08.124
You'll get sick if you go outside.

01:21:08.198 --> 01:21:10.132
So stay here and play with me.

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:12.725
- You won't get sick.
- Yes, you will.

01:21:12.803 --> 01:21:14.737
That's why I've never left this room.

01:21:14.805 --> 01:21:17.603
Staying in this room
is what'll make you sick.

01:21:17.674 --> 01:21:21.576
Listen, someone very important
to me is terribly hurt.

01:21:21.645 --> 01:21:24.546
I've got to go right now,
so please let go of me.

01:21:24.614 --> 01:21:27.606
If you go I'll cry,
and Mama will hear me...

01:21:27.684 --> 01:21:30.050
and Mama will come in here and kill you.

01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:33.556
- Play with me, or I'll break your arm.
- That hurts!

01:21:33.623 --> 01:21:35.682
Please! I'll play with you later, okay?

01:21:35.759 --> 01:21:39.923
- No, I wanna play now!

01:21:39.996 --> 01:21:43.762
- Germs! I've got germs, see?

01:21:54.945 --> 01:21:56.936
Haku!

01:21:57.013 --> 01:22:00.312
What are you doing? Get away!
Get back! Haku, are you okay?

01:22:00.383 --> 01:22:02.374
- Can you hear me?

01:22:02.452 --> 01:22:04.818
- Shut your mouth! Haku!

01:22:07.791 --> 01:22:11.318
- Get back!

01:22:13.496 --> 01:22:16.294
Stop it!

01:22:30.213 --> 01:22:34.149
I'm not afraid of germs.
If you don't play with me, I'll cry.

01:22:34.217 --> 01:22:36.151
Please don't cry. Just wait.

01:22:36.219 --> 01:22:39.245
Right now, or I'll start crying.

01:22:41.491 --> 01:22:43.425
Don't cry! Don't cry!

01:22:43.493 --> 01:22:46.394
What a spoiled brat!

01:22:46.463 --> 01:22:49.125
Shut your big mouth!

01:22:49.199 --> 01:22:51.360
You're a bit of a porker, aren't you?

01:22:58.008 --> 01:23:01.068
- Hmm. Still see-through.
- Mama?

01:23:01.144 --> 01:23:06.241
You pea-brain. Can't you even tell me
from your own mother?

01:23:13.356 --> 01:23:16.883
There, now. Your body
matches your brain.

01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:20.225
Let's see.
What else can we mess with?

01:23:38.281 --> 01:23:40.215
This is our little secret.

01:23:40.283 --> 01:23:43.081
You tell anyone else,
and I'll rip your mouth out.

01:23:44.821 --> 01:23:48.689
- Who are you?
- Zaneba. I'm Yubaba's twin sister.

01:23:48.758 --> 01:23:52.387
It was nice of you to lead me
straight to this dragon's hiding place.

01:23:52.462 --> 01:23:54.396
Now, hand him over to me.

01:23:54.464 --> 01:23:56.955
What do you want with Haku?
He's badly hurt.

01:23:57.033 --> 01:24:00.867
Too bad. He stole my solid gold seal.

01:24:00.937 --> 01:24:03.599
It's magic and powerful,
and I want it back!

01:24:03.673 --> 01:24:06.574
Haku wouldn't steal.
He's a good person.

01:24:06.643 --> 01:24:10.773
Huh! Do you know why he became
my sister's apprentice?

01:24:10.847 --> 01:24:15.284
To steal her magic secrets,
and now he's stolen my magic too.

01:24:15.352 --> 01:24:19.516
He's a greedy little thief.
There's nothing good about him.

01:24:19.589 --> 01:24:24.549
Step aside, little girl.
I'm going to take my seal back from him.

01:24:24.627 --> 01:24:29.758
There's a spell on the seal,
and anyone who steals it will die.

01:24:29.833 --> 01:24:32.768
- No, you can't!

01:24:39.442 --> 01:24:42.934
You idiots! What's your problem?

01:24:43.013 --> 01:24:46.813
Keep quiet. I don't want my sister
coming up here.

01:24:52.622 --> 01:24:54.783
Ow. A paper cut.

01:24:55.091 --> 01:24:57.252
Haku, we're falling!

01:25:16.846 --> 01:25:18.746
Haku!

01:25:46.810 --> 01:25:49.904
- What's going on here?
Sen, be careful! Stay back!
- Haku!

01:25:51.214 --> 01:25:54.183
Are you okay? Haku!

01:25:57.253 --> 01:26:00.484
- What's wrong with you?

01:26:02.859 --> 01:26:05.293
This looks serious.

01:26:06.996 --> 01:26:10.193
Haku, don't give up!
What do we do? Is he dying?

01:26:10.266 --> 01:26:13.599
It looks like he's bleeding
from the inside.

01:26:13.670 --> 01:26:18.073
- From the inside?
- I think so.
Maybe he swallowed something.

01:26:18.141 --> 01:26:21.838
Haku, I got this gift
from the river spirit.

01:26:21.911 --> 01:26:23.936
Eat it. Maybe it'll help.

01:26:26.049 --> 01:26:28.449
Come on! Open your mouth!

01:26:28.518 --> 01:26:31.282
Please, Haku! Eat it!

01:26:32.922 --> 01:26:34.856
See? It's okay.

01:26:34.924 --> 01:26:37.188
Medicine from the river spirit.

01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:40.525
Open your mouth. That's it.

01:26:43.733 --> 01:26:46.099
Got it.

01:26:46.169 --> 01:26:48.330
- Now swallow.

01:27:05.922 --> 01:27:08.948
- Sen, look there!

01:27:19.602 --> 01:27:23.333
- The gold seal!
- Get that black slug!
Over there! Get it!

01:27:23.406 --> 01:27:26.239
Get it!
Get it!

01:27:39.589 --> 01:27:43.047
You killed it?
Those things are bad luck.

01:27:43.126 --> 01:27:45.686
Hurry, before it rubs off on you!

01:27:45.762 --> 01:27:49.254
Put your thumbs
and forefingers together.

01:27:49.332 --> 01:27:53.735
- Evil, be gone!
- Haku stole this seal
from Yubaba's sister.

01:27:53.803 --> 01:27:56.738
Zaneba's solid gold
monogrammed seal.

01:27:56.806 --> 01:27:59.502
That's as powerful as it gets.

01:28:01.711 --> 01:28:03.645
Look! He's changed back.

01:28:03.713 --> 01:28:05.647
Help me. What do we do?

01:28:07.784 --> 01:28:10.344
- Haku! Haku, wake up!

01:28:12.422 --> 01:28:14.481
Zaneba put a curse on the seal.

01:28:14.557 --> 01:28:18.357
That's strong magic.
It's made him gravely ill.

01:28:27.704 --> 01:28:30.502
That should make him
more comfortable.

01:28:33.243 --> 01:28:36.838
Poor Haku. He's had it
hard ever since he got here.

01:28:36.913 --> 01:28:40.974
He just showed up
out of nowhere, just like you did.

01:28:41.050 --> 01:28:45.282
But he got mixed up with Yubaba.
He took a job as her apprentice.

01:28:45.355 --> 01:28:47.949
I warned him it was too dangerous.
"Just quit.

01:28:48.024 --> 01:28:50.356
Go back home, "I told him.

01:28:50.426 --> 01:28:54.522
But he said for some reason
he had no home to return to.

01:28:54.597 --> 01:28:56.861
Once Yubaba
got control over him...

01:28:56.933 --> 01:29:00.767
his face turned pale
and his eyes turned steely.

01:29:00.837 --> 01:29:04.068
- He's never been the same.

01:29:04.140 --> 01:29:08.133
Kamajii, what if I take
the gold seal back to Zaneba?

01:29:08.211 --> 01:29:11.874
I could give back the seal
and apologize to her for Haku.

01:29:11.948 --> 01:29:14.007
Can you tell me
where Zaneba lives?

01:29:14.083 --> 01:29:16.415
You'd go to Zaneba's?

01:29:16.486 --> 01:29:19.978
- It might help, but she's
one dangerous witch.
- Please?

01:29:20.056 --> 01:29:24.220
Haku helped me before.
Now I wanna help him.

01:29:24.294 --> 01:29:26.387
Hmm.

01:29:26.462 --> 01:29:31.661
I know how you can get there,
but you'll have to get back on your own.

01:29:31.734 --> 01:29:34.225
Wait here.

01:29:34.304 --> 01:29:38.934
Let's see, now. I know it's
around here somewhere.

01:29:39.008 --> 01:29:42.671
Everyone, I need my shoes
and clothes, please.

01:29:44.547 --> 01:29:47.038
I guess my parents will have to wait.

01:29:51.254 --> 01:29:53.916
Sen! I've looked everywhere for you.

01:29:56.659 --> 01:29:58.786
- Rin!
- There's blood everywhere.

01:29:58.861 --> 01:30:02.194
What's going on here?
Who are those guys?

01:30:02.265 --> 01:30:05.564
I picked up some new friends. See?

01:30:05.635 --> 01:30:09.036
- Everyone's looking for you.
Yubaba is furious.
- Huh?

01:30:09.105 --> 01:30:12.802
The guy with all the gold
turned out to be a monster
called "No-Face."

01:30:12.875 --> 01:30:16.003
And he says that you
let him into the bathhouse.

01:30:18.448 --> 01:30:20.382
I did let him in.

01:30:20.450 --> 01:30:22.418
Are you serious?

01:30:22.485 --> 01:30:24.544
Yeah. I thought he was a customer.

01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:27.589
What? He's a monster.
He's already swallowed three people.

01:30:27.657 --> 01:30:31.286
Found it! Here it is, Sen.

01:30:31.361 --> 01:30:35.821
- Hey, we're busy, boiler man.
- You can use this.

01:30:35.898 --> 01:30:39.095
You've got train tickets?
Uh, how did you get a hold of them?

01:30:39.168 --> 01:30:41.728
I've been saving them
for 40 years.

01:30:41.804 --> 01:30:45.467
Now, listen carefully. The train stop
you want is called Swamp Bottom.

01:30:45.541 --> 01:30:47.941
- Swamp Bottom?
- That's where Zaneba lives.

01:30:48.010 --> 01:30:49.944
- The sixth stop.
- Sixth stop.

01:30:50.012 --> 01:30:53.607
Make sure you get it right.
The train used to run
in both directions...

01:30:53.683 --> 01:30:55.708
but these days it's a one-way ride.

01:30:55.785 --> 01:30:57.719
Still want to go?

01:30:57.787 --> 01:31:02.383
Yep. I'll walk back along the tracks.

01:31:02.458 --> 01:31:06.519
- Sen, what about No-Face?
- I'll take care of that now.

01:31:06.596 --> 01:31:10.532
Haku, I'll be back soon.
Just hold on.

01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:13.034
What's going on?

01:31:13.102 --> 01:31:15.900
Something you wouldn't recognize.
It's called "love."

01:31:23.613 --> 01:31:26.411
- He just keeps getting bigger!
- I'm scared.

01:31:26.482 --> 01:31:28.916
- I don't wanna be eaten by it.
- It's her.

01:31:36.926 --> 01:31:39.895
Oh, Sen, thank goodness.
Yubaba can't hold him off much longer.

01:31:42.265 --> 01:31:44.256
There's no need to get upset.

01:31:44.333 --> 01:31:47.928
- I'm sure they'll find Sen somewhere.

01:31:48.004 --> 01:31:50.199
Where is Sen? I want Sen!

01:31:50.273 --> 01:31:52.173
Hurry! This way!

01:31:57.780 --> 01:32:01.079
- Madam, Sen is here now.
- Finally!

01:32:01.150 --> 01:32:06.019
Sen has arrived, sir. She'll be
with you in just a few minutes.

01:32:06.088 --> 01:32:09.990
- He's destroying everything.
It's costing us a fortune.

01:32:10.059 --> 01:32:14.018
So suck up to him and get every last
speck of gold he's...

01:32:16.098 --> 01:32:19.534
Ew! What's that dirty mouse doing here?

01:32:19.602 --> 01:32:23.060
Huh? He's your...
He doesn't look familiar?

01:32:23.139 --> 01:32:27.633
Familiar? Don't be stupid.
Now, get in there.

01:32:29.145 --> 01:32:31.636
Here's Sen.

01:32:31.714 --> 01:32:34.945
Will Sen be all right
in there by herself?

01:32:35.017 --> 01:32:37.952
- You wanna take her place? Hmph!
- Huh?

01:32:57.540 --> 01:33:00.634
Try this. It's delicious.

01:33:02.578 --> 01:33:06.742
Want some gold? I'm not giving it
to anybody else.

01:33:10.353 --> 01:33:13.880
Come closer, Sen.
What would you like?

01:33:13.956 --> 01:33:16.288
Just name it.

01:33:16.359 --> 01:33:18.452
I would like to leave, sir.

01:33:18.528 --> 01:33:21.019
I have someplace
I need to go to right away, please.

01:33:23.132 --> 01:33:25.862
You should go back
to where you came from.

01:33:25.935 --> 01:33:30.565
Yubaba doesn't want you
in the bathhouse any longer.

01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:33.871
Where is your home?
Don't you have any friends or family?

01:33:35.278 --> 01:33:38.008
No. No!

01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:40.810
I'm lonely.
I'm lonely.

01:33:42.985 --> 01:33:45.044
What is it that you want?

01:33:45.121 --> 01:33:48.454
I want Sen.
I want Sen!

01:33:49.725 --> 01:33:51.716
Take the gold. Take it!

01:33:51.794 --> 01:33:54.388
- Are you going to eat me?
- Take it!

01:33:54.463 --> 01:33:56.658
- Ooh! Huh?

01:33:58.601 --> 01:34:00.865
- Huh.
- Ow.

01:34:03.406 --> 01:34:06.341
If you want to eat me,
eat this first.

01:34:06.409 --> 01:34:09.173
I was saving this for my parents...

01:34:09.245 --> 01:34:12.009
but I think you'd better have it.

01:34:32.268 --> 01:34:35.328
- Sen!

01:34:35.404 --> 01:34:37.804
Sen, what did you do to me?

01:34:40.076 --> 01:34:42.010
Aah!

01:34:53.623 --> 01:34:56.023
Enough! I don't care if he's rich!

01:34:57.259 --> 01:34:59.750
This nonsense has gotta stop!

01:35:12.274 --> 01:35:14.208
No-Face!

01:35:14.276 --> 01:35:16.710
Over here!

01:35:24.153 --> 01:35:26.053
Run for your life!

01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:57.418
Now, that's an esophagus!

01:35:59.855 --> 01:36:02.756
I'll get you for this, Sen!

01:36:04.994 --> 01:36:06.985
Duck!

01:36:16.972 --> 01:36:18.872
Excuse me.

01:36:20.076 --> 01:36:22.010
Sen, this way!

01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:40.360
Hey, over here!

01:36:40.429 --> 01:36:42.363
Sen, don't call him over!

01:36:45.968 --> 01:36:48.903
I think being in the bathhouse
makes him crazy.

01:36:48.971 --> 01:36:50.905
He needs to get out of there.

01:36:50.973 --> 01:36:53.567
- Yeah? And go where?
- I don't know.

01:36:53.642 --> 01:36:57.874
You don't know? Great.
Now he's following us.

01:36:57.947 --> 01:36:59.881
He won't hurt us.

01:37:11.794 --> 01:37:14.558
Hmm?

01:37:14.630 --> 01:37:17.428
- You'll have to walk from here.
- Okay.

01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:19.627
The station's just down the tracks.

01:37:19.702 --> 01:37:21.636
Thanks, Rin.

01:37:21.704 --> 01:37:25.640
- You better come back, you hear me?
- I will.

01:37:28.644 --> 01:37:33.775
Sen, I'm sorry I called you
a dope before! I take it back!

01:37:41.957 --> 01:37:46.053
No-Face, if you put even one scratch
on that girl, you're in big trouble.

01:37:49.398 --> 01:37:51.958
There's the station.

01:38:02.077 --> 01:38:04.068
Here comes the train. Come on.

01:38:26.735 --> 01:38:30.432
Oh. We'd like to go
to Swamp Bottom, please.

01:38:34.710 --> 01:38:37.042
Huh?

01:38:37.112 --> 01:38:39.637
- Oh. You wanna come with us?
- Uh-huh.

01:38:39.715 --> 01:38:42.149
He'd like to come too, please.

01:39:18.988 --> 01:39:21.218
Uh... Uh...

01:39:22.591 --> 01:39:26.186
Sit here. Behave yourself, okay?

01:41:28.350 --> 01:41:30.511
- Kamajii, wake up.
- Hmm?

01:41:32.287 --> 01:41:36.553
- Haku, you're all right.
- I'm fine. Where is Sen?

01:41:36.625 --> 01:41:39.526
Did she go somewhere?
Can you tell me what's going on?

01:41:39.595 --> 01:41:42.655
You blacked out, remember?

01:41:42.731 --> 01:41:45.529
Yeah, I remember being in darkness.

01:41:45.601 --> 01:41:48.661
Then I could hear Sen's voice
calling out my name.

01:41:48.737 --> 01:41:50.932
So I followed her voice,
and the next thing I knew...

01:41:51.006 --> 01:41:52.940
I was lying here
feeling better than ever.

01:41:53.008 --> 01:41:57.001
Pure love. It broke Zaneba's spell.

01:41:57.079 --> 01:42:00.071
Sen left to return the golden seal.

01:42:00.149 --> 01:42:02.344
She did it to save you.

01:42:02.418 --> 01:42:05.785
This gold doesn't even come close...

01:42:05.854 --> 01:42:09.290
to covering the damage
that stupid No-Face caused.

01:42:09.358 --> 01:42:12.191
Sen didn't get nearly enough.
She'll have to be punished.

01:42:12.261 --> 01:42:16.459
- Madam, you see, Sen was the one
that saved us from No-Face.
- Yes, yes.

01:42:16.532 --> 01:42:20.298
So what?
This whole mess is her fault.

01:42:20.369 --> 01:42:22.929
And now she's run away from here.

01:42:23.005 --> 01:42:25.371
She's even abandoned
her own parents!

01:42:25.441 --> 01:42:28.638
- Those pigs must be ready
to eat by now.

01:42:28.710 --> 01:42:32.476
- Turn them into bacon.
- Wait a minute.

01:42:32.548 --> 01:42:34.482
- Huh?
- Master Haku?

01:42:34.550 --> 01:42:38.748
You're still alive?
What is it you want?

01:42:38.821 --> 01:42:42.257
You still haven't noticed that something
precious to you has been replaced.

01:42:42.324 --> 01:42:45.691
Don't get fresh with me, young man.

01:42:45.761 --> 01:42:48.161
Since when do you talk
that way to your master?

01:42:57.206 --> 01:42:59.697
Huh.

01:43:39.948 --> 01:43:42.178
My baby!

01:43:44.086 --> 01:43:46.646
No!

01:43:48.557 --> 01:43:50.491
- My baby!
- It's just dirt.

01:43:50.559 --> 01:43:53.585
Where's my baby?

01:43:53.662 --> 01:43:56.597
Where are you, sweetie?

01:43:57.833 --> 01:44:00.734
Come out! Please, come out!

01:44:00.802 --> 01:44:02.702
Where are you?

01:44:05.641 --> 01:44:09.168
Sweetie!
Sweetie pie!

01:44:12.748 --> 01:44:14.978
You!

01:44:17.553 --> 01:44:22.047
Where is he?

01:44:23.592 --> 01:44:28.154
What did you do with my baby?

01:44:28.230 --> 01:44:30.164
He's with your sister.

01:44:30.232 --> 01:44:32.257
Zaneba?

01:44:35.904 --> 01:44:37.838
Uh...

01:44:53.555 --> 01:44:56.752
Very clever, Haku. I get it.

01:44:56.825 --> 01:44:59.692
You'll get my baby back for me,
but at a price.

01:44:59.761 --> 01:45:03.458
So, what do you want?

01:45:03.532 --> 01:45:05.966
Tear up Sen's contract.

01:45:06.034 --> 01:45:10.494
And then I want you to return
Sen and her mother and father
back to the human world.

01:45:10.572 --> 01:45:13.040
Fine, but on one condition.

01:45:13.108 --> 01:45:17.044
I get to give Sen one final test.

01:45:17.112 --> 01:45:19.012
If she fails, she's mine.

01:46:02.958 --> 01:46:05.859
I hope this is the right stop.

01:46:06.995 --> 01:46:08.986
Let's go.

01:46:35.023 --> 01:46:37.821
You can ride on my shoulder
if you're tired.

01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:47.368
Hmm?

01:47:55.137 --> 01:47:57.071
Come in.

01:48:01.510 --> 01:48:03.535
Hello?

01:48:05.881 --> 01:48:08.475
Hurry up. I don't have all day.

01:48:08.550 --> 01:48:10.450
Come on.

01:48:13.388 --> 01:48:16.186
- So, you all made it.
- Hmm?

01:48:16.258 --> 01:48:19.659
Sit down. I'll make some tea.

01:48:26.168 --> 01:48:29.899
Excuse me, ma'am. Haku stole this
from you. I came to give it back.

01:48:29.971 --> 01:48:32.633
I see.

01:48:32.707 --> 01:48:35.642
Do you have any idea what this is?

01:48:35.710 --> 01:48:38.941
Yes. It's the golden seal
you were looking for.

01:48:39.014 --> 01:48:42.973
I'm here to apologize for Haku.
I'm very sorry.

01:48:43.051 --> 01:48:46.919
He sliced me in two, you know,
and I'm still angry.

01:48:46.988 --> 01:48:50.515
- What?
- What? The protective spell is gone.

01:48:50.592 --> 01:48:54.756
I'm sorry. You mean that black slug
that was on your seal?

01:48:54.830 --> 01:48:56.764
I think I squashed it with my foot.

01:48:56.832 --> 01:48:59.062
Squashed it?

01:49:01.470 --> 01:49:03.563
That wasn't my slug.

01:49:03.638 --> 01:49:07.836
My sister put that slug into Haku
so she could control him.

01:49:07.909 --> 01:49:10.742
You squashed it.

01:49:12.814 --> 01:49:15.112
What happened to my spell?

01:49:15.183 --> 01:49:17.913
Only love can break it.
Come, now.

01:49:17.986 --> 01:49:22.719
Can you please turn these two
back into their normal forms?

01:49:22.791 --> 01:49:25.885
The spell on those two
wore off long ago.

01:49:25.961 --> 01:49:28.896
Change back if you want.

01:49:34.970 --> 01:49:37.461
I don't get along with my sister.

01:49:37.539 --> 01:49:39.700
She's so obnoxious.

01:49:39.774 --> 01:49:42.106
You saw how tacky her home is.

01:49:42.177 --> 01:49:45.237
- We're identical twins,
yet exact opposites.

01:49:49.251 --> 01:49:52.345
I'm sorry she turned
your parents into pigs.

01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:55.787
But there's nothing I can do.
It's just the way things are.

01:49:55.857 --> 01:49:58.917
You'll have to help your parents
and Haku on your own.

01:49:58.994 --> 01:50:00.985
Use what you remember
about them.

01:50:01.062 --> 01:50:04.031
What? Can't you please
give me more of a hint than that?

01:50:04.099 --> 01:50:08.035
It seems like I met Haku before,
but it was a long time ago.

01:50:08.103 --> 01:50:10.037
That's a good start.

01:50:10.105 --> 01:50:13.973
Once you've met someone,
you never really forget them.

01:50:14.042 --> 01:50:17.637
It just takes a while
for your memories to return.

01:50:17.712 --> 01:50:21.739
While you're thinking, the boys
and I are going to make you something.

01:50:21.816 --> 01:50:25.013
And I want you
to call me Granny from now on.

01:50:28.523 --> 01:50:30.616
- Ah, come on. Keep at it.

01:50:33.562 --> 01:50:38.499
No-Face, where did you
learn to spin thread?
You're really good at this.

01:50:38.567 --> 01:50:42.264
Now let's weave
the threads together.

01:50:43.605 --> 01:50:46.335
Knit one, pearl two.
Knit one, pearl two.

01:50:46.408 --> 01:50:48.342
Knit one... That's right.

01:50:48.410 --> 01:50:51.538
Granny, I can't remember
anything at all.

01:50:51.613 --> 01:50:55.572
Haku could be dead already,
and I'm just sitting around here.

01:50:55.650 --> 01:50:59.586
My mom and dad could've
been eaten for dinner.

01:51:01.056 --> 01:51:03.490
Wait just a little bit longer.

01:51:03.558 --> 01:51:05.458
Ahh. There we go.

01:51:05.527 --> 01:51:08.360
Use it to tie back your hair.

01:51:12.500 --> 01:51:14.434
It's beautiful.

01:51:14.502 --> 01:51:16.629
It'll protect you.

01:51:16.705 --> 01:51:19.538
It's made from the threads
your friends wove together.

01:51:19.608 --> 01:51:21.542
Thank you.

01:51:30.418 --> 01:51:33.546
What good timing.
We've got another guest.

01:51:33.622 --> 01:51:36.682
- Will you let him in?
- Sure.

01:51:48.403 --> 01:51:52.931
Haku! Haku.

01:51:53.008 --> 01:51:55.306
Thank goodness.

01:51:55.377 --> 01:51:58.972
You're alive! I can't believe it.
How did it happen?

01:51:59.047 --> 01:52:00.981
Ahh.

01:52:01.049 --> 01:52:03.483
That's love for you.

01:52:03.551 --> 01:52:06.850
Look, Granny. Haku's alive.

01:52:06.921 --> 01:52:10.880
- Haku, I will forgive you
for stealing my precious seal.

01:52:10.959 --> 01:52:14.395
But in return,
you must take care of this girl.

01:52:14.462 --> 01:52:18.023
Okay, you two,
it's time to go home.

01:52:18.099 --> 01:52:20.431
Come back soon.

01:52:20.502 --> 01:52:23.300
No-Face,
why don't you stay with me?

01:52:23.371 --> 01:52:26.397
- I could use a good helper.

01:52:26.474 --> 01:52:28.408
Granny!

01:52:28.476 --> 01:52:31.206
Thank you so much. I'll miss you.

01:52:31.279 --> 01:52:34.646
Don't worry. You'll be all right, Sen.

01:52:34.716 --> 01:52:38.049
I want you to know my real name.
It's Chihiro.

01:52:38.119 --> 01:52:40.610
Chihiro. What a pretty name.

01:52:40.689 --> 01:52:43.453
- You take good care of it.
- I will.

01:52:43.525 --> 01:52:46.426
- Off you go.
- Okay. Bye.

01:52:46.494 --> 01:52:50.954
Granny, take care!
Thanks for everything!

01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:40.505
Haku, listen.

01:53:40.582 --> 01:53:44.416
I just remembered something
from a long time ago.
I think it may help you.

01:53:44.486 --> 01:53:48.422
Once, when I was little,
I dropped my shoe into a river.

01:53:48.490 --> 01:53:51.982
And when I tried
to get it back, I fell in.

01:53:52.060 --> 01:53:55.655
I thought I'd drown, but the water
carried me to shore.

01:53:55.730 --> 01:53:58.324
It finally came back to me.

01:53:58.399 --> 01:54:01.493
The river's name was
the Kalaku River.

01:54:01.569 --> 01:54:05.403
I think that was you,
and your real name is Kalaku River!

01:54:26.528 --> 01:54:29.088
You did it, Chihiro! I remember.

01:54:29.164 --> 01:54:31.462
I was the spirit of the Kalaku River.

01:54:31.533 --> 01:54:35.162
- A river spirit?
- My name is the Kalaku River.

01:54:35.236 --> 01:54:37.932
They filled in that river.
It's all apartments now.

01:54:38.006 --> 01:54:40.804
That must be why I can't
find my way home, Chihiro.

01:54:40.875 --> 01:54:44.504
I remember you falling into my river,
and I remember your little pink shoe.

01:54:44.579 --> 01:54:47.742
So you're the one who carried me back
into shallow water.

01:54:47.816 --> 01:54:51.149
You saved me.
I knew you were good.

01:55:23.985 --> 01:55:26.385
- Hey, there they are!

01:55:38.166 --> 01:55:41.727
I see you failed
to bring my baby back.

01:55:44.172 --> 01:55:46.572
- Mama!
- My baby!

01:55:46.641 --> 01:55:50.771
Are you traumatized?
Did they do terrible things to you?

01:55:50.845 --> 01:55:54.042
You're standing all by yourself.
When did that happen?

01:55:54.115 --> 01:55:56.549
Don't forget your promise.

01:55:56.618 --> 01:55:59.815
You must return Chihiro
and her parents to the human world.

01:55:59.888 --> 01:56:03.187
Hmph! Not so fast, Haku.

01:56:03.258 --> 01:56:05.419
I get to give Sen one final test.

01:56:05.493 --> 01:56:07.893
- Shut up!

01:56:07.962 --> 01:56:10.260
Stop it, Mama. Leave her alone.

01:56:10.331 --> 01:56:13.926
- Sen and I had a really good time.

01:56:14.002 --> 01:56:16.903
But a deal is a deal, sweetie.

01:56:16.971 --> 01:56:19.166
I have to give Sen one final test.

01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:22.573
If you make Sen cry,
I won't like you anymore.

01:56:22.644 --> 01:56:27.047
- But... Granny?
- Hey, Granny!

01:56:27.115 --> 01:56:29.515
You're right. A deal's a deal.

01:56:40.895 --> 01:56:43.125
Okay, I'm ready. I'll take your test.

01:56:43.197 --> 01:56:45.131
Hmm. You've got guts.

01:56:45.199 --> 01:56:48.600
I've got your contract right here.
Come this way.

01:56:48.670 --> 01:56:51.605
This'll only take a minute.

01:56:51.673 --> 01:56:54.164
Don't worry.

01:56:57.445 --> 01:57:01.279
See if you can tell which of these pigs
is your mother and father.

01:57:10.525 --> 01:57:12.459
You get one try.

01:57:12.527 --> 01:57:14.927
If you get it right,
you can all go home.

01:57:25.506 --> 01:57:28.270
Huh? There must be a mistake.

01:57:28.343 --> 01:57:30.436
None of these pigs
are my mom or dad.

01:57:30.511 --> 01:57:34.174
None of them?
Is that really your answer?

01:57:35.750 --> 01:57:38.344
- Mm-hmm.

01:57:39.754 --> 01:57:42.882
Oh, you got it!

01:57:48.696 --> 01:57:50.857
Thank you, everyone.

01:57:50.932 --> 01:57:54.368
All right, you win.
Get out of my sight.

01:57:54.435 --> 01:57:58.428
Thanks for everything, Granny. Good-bye!

01:57:58.506 --> 01:58:01.441
- Good-bye!
- Thank you!

01:58:01.509 --> 01:58:03.500
- Haku!
- Let's go!

01:58:03.578 --> 01:58:06.775
- Where are my mom and dad?
- When you passed the test...

01:58:06.848 --> 01:58:08.873
they woke up
on the human side of the river.

01:58:08.950 --> 01:58:11.384
They're there now,
and they're looking for you.

01:58:11.452 --> 01:58:14.080
There's no water here.

01:58:14.155 --> 01:58:17.386
- I can walk across now.
- But I can't go any farther.

01:58:17.458 --> 01:58:19.824
Just go back the way you came.
You'll be fine.

01:58:19.894 --> 01:58:23.352
But you have to promise not to
look back, not until you've
passed through the tunnel.

01:58:23.431 --> 01:58:25.592
What about you? What'll you do?

01:58:25.666 --> 01:58:28.965
Don't worry. I'll go back
and have a talk with Yubaba.

01:58:29.037 --> 01:58:31.528
I'll tell her I'm going
to quit being her apprentice.

01:58:31.606 --> 01:58:34.006
I'm fine. I got my name back.

01:58:34.075 --> 01:58:36.566
- Will we meet again sometime?
- Sure we will.

01:58:36.644 --> 01:58:38.578
- Promise?
- Promise.

01:58:38.646 --> 01:58:40.546
Now go, and don't look back.

01:59:03.037 --> 01:59:04.971
- Chihiro!

01:59:05.039 --> 01:59:07.974
Where have you been?
Hurry up!

01:59:11.112 --> 01:59:13.342
Mom, Dad!

01:59:13.414 --> 01:59:17.111
- You shouldn't run off like that, honey.
- You could get in big trouble.

01:59:17.185 --> 01:59:19.551
Are you guys sure you're all right?

01:59:19.620 --> 01:59:22.555
Let's go.
I don't wanna miss the movers.

01:59:32.633 --> 01:59:34.794
Chihiro, hurry up.

01:59:43.611 --> 01:59:46.307
Everybody, watch your step.

01:59:46.380 --> 01:59:49.144
Chihiro, don't cling like that.
You'll make me trip.

02:00:01.562 --> 02:00:04.156
We made it.
Hey, what happened?

02:00:04.232 --> 02:00:06.166
What is it?

02:00:06.234 --> 02:00:08.168
Look at that.

02:00:10.104 --> 02:00:14.040
- It's all dusty inside too.
- Is this someone's idea of a joke?

02:00:14.108 --> 02:00:16.906
- Looks like it.
- I told you we shouldn't have stopped.

02:00:22.850 --> 02:00:26.513
Come on, Chihiro.
Let's get to our new home.

02:00:26.587 --> 02:00:28.578
You're not scared, are you?

02:00:28.656 --> 02:00:31.420
Don't be afraid, honey.
Everything's gonna be okay.

02:00:44.839 --> 02:00:48.741
A new home and a new school?
It is a bit scary.

02:00:48.809 --> 02:00:51.039
I think I can handle it.
