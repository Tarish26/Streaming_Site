00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:55.937
Once in a while when I wake up

00:00:56.896 --> 00:00:59.774
I find myself crying.

00:01:00.483 --> 00:01:02.484
The dream I must have had

00:01:02.485 --> 00:01:04.153
I can never recall.

00:01:04.737 --> 00:01:05.822
But...

00:01:06.364 --> 00:01:07.531
But...

00:01:07.532 --> 00:01:10.784
the sensation that I've lost something

00:01:10.785 --> 00:01:13.913
lingers for a long time after I wake up.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.631
I'm always searching

00:01:24.382 --> 00:01:26.718
for something, for someone.

00:01:27.302 --> 00:01:30.137
This feeling has possessed me

00:01:30.138 --> 00:01:31.973
I think from that day...

00:01:33.308 --> 00:01:36.394
That day when the stars came falling.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.603
It was almost as if...

00:01:38.604 --> 00:01:41.357
as if a scene from a dream.

00:01:41.858 --> 00:01:43.401
Nothing more, nothing less

00:01:44.861 --> 00:01:46.904
than a beautiful view.

00:01:47.488 --> 00:01:51.743
Ah, if only our voices speak at night

00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:58.582
could ever reach the very edge
of this world, and the time

00:01:58.583 --> 00:02:03.004
Instead of fading into air and dust

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:06.465
Then what will the words could ever be?

00:02:06.466 --> 00:02:09.259
Farthest words from 'probably'

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:16.142
Let's make a promise, that will never fade.
Let's say it together in count of three, oh

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:29.654
Ah, I'm told that some part of
every wish will be heard

00:02:29.655 --> 00:02:32.324
But lately I lost sight
of the truth in those words

00:02:32.325 --> 00:02:37.120
I can't even remember when I gave up
believing. What could have been the reason?

00:02:37.121 --> 00:02:40.457
Ah, the very moment that the rain will stop

00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:43.126
And the place rainbow born and dies

00:02:43.127 --> 00:02:45.045
And where the end of this life lies

00:02:45.046 --> 00:02:48.633
I've always been insisting there was
something that I've longing for

00:02:53.304 --> 00:02:54.638
One day we'll reach to

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.392
emotions unexplored unprecedented

00:02:58.393 --> 00:03:01.353
We'll high-five love we've yet to discover

00:03:01.354 --> 00:03:03.480
and give a kiss to time

00:03:03.481 --> 00:03:08.903
The five dimensions keep on teasing me.
But I will keep on looking at you, dear

00:03:09.112 --> 00:03:12.532
Let's make a sign for
when we say nice to meet you again

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.995
I'm on my way to you,
chasing after your name

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:48.317
Taki. Taki.

00:03:49.318 --> 00:03:51.279
Don't you remember me?

00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:54.991
My name is...

00:03:56.742 --> 00:03:57.952
Mitsuha!

00:04:33.946 --> 00:04:36.032
Mitsuha, what are you doing?

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.619
Well, it feels incredibly realistic...

00:04:40.703 --> 00:04:42.746
What? "Mitsuha"?

00:04:42.747 --> 00:04:45.791
Are you half asleep? Breakfast!

00:04:46.083 --> 00:04:46.876
Hurry up!

00:05:07.104 --> 00:05:11.234
What? What?

00:05:18.616 --> 00:05:21.117
Do you want last night's leftovers?

00:05:21.118 --> 00:05:22.994
You can have it.

00:05:22.995 --> 00:05:24.829
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.623
Mitsuha, you're late!

00:05:26.624 --> 00:05:28.709
I'll make breakfast tomorrow.

00:05:34.549 --> 00:05:35.966
Is this too much?

00:05:35.967 --> 00:05:37.051
Well. It's okay

00:05:37.635 --> 00:05:39.220
You're normal today.

00:05:39.804 --> 00:05:41.805
You were nuts yesterday.

00:05:41.806 --> 00:05:43.766
What are you talking about?

00:05:45.768 --> 00:05:49.397
Good morning, everyone.

00:05:49.855 --> 00:05:54.151
This is an announcement
from Itomori Town Hall.

00:05:54.694 --> 00:05:57.737
Regarding the mayoral election

00:05:57.738 --> 00:06:01.116
on the 20th next month,

00:06:01.117 --> 00:06:02.159
the election committee...

00:06:05.246 --> 00:06:06.122
"Comet to pass by in a month:
Visible to the naked eye"

00:06:06.205 --> 00:06:08.583
A comet with an orbital period of

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.252
1,200 years will pass by in a month.

00:06:11.586 --> 00:06:13.503
The comet will be visible

00:06:13.504 --> 00:06:15.880
to the naked eye for several days...

00:06:15.881 --> 00:06:17.924
It's time for you to make up with him.

00:06:17.925 --> 00:06:18.968
It's an adult matter.

00:06:19.051 --> 00:06:19.885
"Position of Cornet Tiamat"

00:06:20.052 --> 00:06:21.469
JAXA are preparing to observe

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.680
the celestial show of the century.

00:06:22.763 --> 00:06:23.556
"Closest on October 4th"

00:06:40.197 --> 00:06:41.741
We're going!

00:07:02.178 --> 00:07:04.430
Study hard!

00:07:09.518 --> 00:07:10.977
Mitsuha!

00:07:10.978 --> 00:07:13.021
Morning, Sayaka, Tessie.

00:07:13.022 --> 00:07:13.981
Morning.

00:07:13.982 --> 00:07:16.858
- Get off.
- Why? Meanie.

00:07:16.859 --> 00:07:18.735
- You're heavy.
- That's rude.

00:07:18.736 --> 00:07:20.987
You two get along so well.

00:07:20.988 --> 00:07:22.239
We do not!

00:07:24.867 --> 00:07:27.369
Your hair looks all right today.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:28.536
What?

00:07:28.537 --> 00:07:29.455
Yeah,

00:07:29.456 --> 00:07:32.208
- did your grandma exorcise you?
- Exorcise?

00:07:32.375 --> 00:07:34.501
You were totally possessed yesterday!

00:07:34.502 --> 00:07:37.045
Cut out the occultism.

00:07:37.046 --> 00:07:39.881
Mitsuha is just stressed. Right?

00:07:39.882 --> 00:07:42.550
Huh? What are you talking about?

00:07:42.551 --> 00:07:43.886
You don't remember?

00:07:45.346 --> 00:07:47.138
And above all,

00:07:47.139 --> 00:07:49.600
restoring the town's fiscal health

00:07:49.892 --> 00:07:52.977
to continue its revitalization project!

00:07:52.978 --> 00:07:54.896
Only when these are achieved

00:07:54.897 --> 00:07:58.442
can a safe and secure community be created!

00:07:58.818 --> 00:08:00.403
As the incumbent mayor...

00:08:01.112 --> 00:08:03.905
He'll be reelected again anyway.

00:08:03.906 --> 00:08:06.950
I heard he's been dishing out the pork.

00:08:06.951 --> 00:08:08.493
Hey, Miyamizu.

00:08:08.494 --> 00:08:09.870
Morning.

00:08:10.454 --> 00:08:11.996
The mayor's kid and

00:08:11.997 --> 00:08:13.790
his contractor's kid get along too.

00:08:13.791 --> 00:08:14.875
Ew.

00:08:19.463 --> 00:08:20.881
Mitsuha!

00:08:21.549 --> 00:08:23.426
Stand up straight!

00:08:24.552 --> 00:08:26.219
He's strict with his family.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.762
I'm impressed.

00:08:27.763 --> 00:08:28.888
So embarrassing.

00:08:28.889 --> 00:08:30.141
Pathetic!

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.101
Mitsuha.

00:08:33.394 --> 00:08:35.646
In front of everybody...

00:08:38.858 --> 00:08:40.025
"Who are you?"

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.075
"Tasokare" (Twilight)

00:08:49.076 --> 00:08:52.954
"Tasokare" means "Who is that" and is

00:08:52.955 --> 00:08:55.498
the origin of the word "tasogare-doki."

00:08:55.499 --> 00:08:59.210
Twilight, when it's neither day nor night.

00:08:59.211 --> 00:09:01.254
When the world blurs and one might

00:09:01.255 --> 00:09:04.675
encounter something not human.

00:09:05.176 --> 00:09:08.679
Older expressions include "karetaso-doki"

00:09:09.764 --> 00:09:12.183
and "kawatare-doki."

00:09:12.683 --> 00:09:15.143
I have a question! Not "kataware-doki"?

00:09:15.144 --> 00:09:18.898
"Kataware-doki"? I think
that's a local dialect.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:20.482
I've heard that Itomori's elderly

00:09:20.483 --> 00:09:21.525
still use classical language.

00:09:21.609 --> 00:09:22.777
"Who are you?"

00:09:22.902 --> 00:09:24.528
We're in the boonies, after all.

00:09:27.281 --> 00:09:29.449
OK next, Mitsuha.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:30.701
Yes.

00:09:31.702 --> 00:09:34.663
Oh, so you remember your name today.

00:09:37.416 --> 00:09:38.918
You don't remember?

00:09:40.878 --> 00:09:42.962
Yesterday you forgot

00:09:42.963 --> 00:09:45.007
where your desk and locker were.

00:09:45.257 --> 00:09:48.302
Your hair is messy with no ribbon.

00:09:50.846 --> 00:09:53.306
What? No way! Really?

00:09:53.307 --> 00:09:55.809
It was like you had amnesia.

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:57.018
Well,

00:09:57.019 --> 00:10:00.397
I do feel like I've been
in a strange dream lately...

00:10:00.606 --> 00:10:03.317
A dream about someone else's life?

00:10:03.859 --> 00:10:06.612
I can't remember clearly.

00:10:06.987 --> 00:10:09.156
I know! That was...

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:10.740
your previous life!

00:10:10.741 --> 00:10:11.575
Or maybe

00:10:11.576 --> 00:10:14.787
your subconscious
linked to the Everett multiverse...

00:10:15.037 --> 00:10:16.162
Stay out of this.

00:10:16.163 --> 00:10:19.667
Oh! Tessie, did you write
that in my notebook?

00:10:21.502 --> 00:10:22.753
Nothing.

00:10:23.963 --> 00:10:27.757
But Mitsuha,
you really were a bit weird yesterday.

00:10:27.758 --> 00:10:29.677
Are you feeling alright?

00:10:30.886 --> 00:10:34.222
That's so strange. I feel fine.

00:10:34.223 --> 00:10:35.723
Maybe you are stressful.

00:10:35.724 --> 00:10:38.226
That ritual is coming up, isn't it?

00:10:38.227 --> 00:10:40.728
Oh, don't remind me!

00:10:40.729 --> 00:10:43.274
I can't stand this town anymore.

00:10:43.858 --> 00:10:46.192
It's too small and packed.

00:10:46.193 --> 00:10:49.529
I want to graduate and go to Tokyo.

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:54.493
I don't blame you.
There's really nothing in here.

00:10:55.995 --> 00:10:58.246
Trains come every 2 hours.

00:10:58.247 --> 00:11:00.290
The store closes at 9 p.m.

00:11:00.291 --> 00:11:02.250
No bookstore. No dentist.

00:11:02.251 --> 00:11:03.002
"Pub Mother" "Pub Cat's Eye"

00:11:03.085 --> 00:11:04.837
But have 2 pubs for some reason.

00:11:05.004 --> 00:11:05.880
No jobs.

00:11:05.881 --> 00:11:07.088
No brides.

00:11:07.089 --> 00:11:09.425
Short sunlight hours.

00:11:11.176 --> 00:11:13.470
- Give me a break!
- What?

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.223
I mean... How about we stop by a cafe?

00:11:17.224 --> 00:11:18.892
- A cafe?
- Really?

00:11:18.893 --> 00:11:20.144
Where?

00:11:24.273 --> 00:11:27.192
Hello.

00:11:31.906 --> 00:11:33.531
This is a cafe?

00:11:33.532 --> 00:11:35.367
You knew there wasn't one.

00:11:35.743 --> 00:11:38.203
Mitsuha just went home.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.789
Things must be rough for her.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:44.292
Because she is the center stage.

00:11:44.293 --> 00:11:45.586
Yeah.

00:11:48.505 --> 00:11:50.131
Hey, Tessie.

00:11:50.132 --> 00:11:51.091
What?

00:11:51.842 --> 00:11:54.261
What will you do after you graduate?

00:11:54.762 --> 00:11:56.304
What's this?

00:11:56.305 --> 00:11:57.681
Are you asking about my future?

00:11:59.308 --> 00:12:00.642
Nothing special.

00:12:00.643 --> 00:12:04.396
I'll probably keep on
living a normal life in this town.

00:12:20.496 --> 00:12:22.623
I'd rather do that too.

00:12:22.873 --> 00:12:25.583
You're not ready yet, Yotsuha.

00:12:25.584 --> 00:12:27.711
Listen to the thread's voice.

00:12:28.003 --> 00:12:31.214
When you keep twining like that,

00:12:31.215 --> 00:12:33.216
emotions will eventually start flowing

00:12:33.217 --> 00:12:35.010
between you and the thread.

00:12:35.594 --> 00:12:37.220
Threads don't talk.

00:12:37.221 --> 00:12:39.347
She means, "Focus."

00:12:39.348 --> 00:12:41.642
1,000 years of Itomori's history is etched

00:12:42.059 --> 00:12:45.311
into our braided cords.

00:12:45.312 --> 00:12:49.273
Listen. 200 years ago...

00:12:49.274 --> 00:12:50.858
Here she goes again.

00:12:50.859 --> 00:12:54.070
Sandal maker Mayugoro's bathroom caught

00:12:54.071 --> 00:12:57.991
on fire and burned down
the whole area around.

00:12:57.992 --> 00:13:01.036
The shrine and old documents were destroyed

00:13:01.453 --> 00:13:02.912
and this is known as...

00:13:02.913 --> 00:13:04.665
The Great Fire of Mayugoro.

00:13:04.999 --> 00:13:09.294
The fire has his name? Poor Mayugoro.

00:13:09.712 --> 00:13:13.256
So the meaning of our festivals became

00:13:13.257 --> 00:13:15.759
unknown and only the formality lived on.

00:13:16.593 --> 00:13:18.594
But even if words are lost,

00:13:18.595 --> 00:13:20.430
tradition should be handed down.

00:13:20.431 --> 00:13:25.019
That's our responsbility
at Miyamizu Shrine.

00:13:27.688 --> 00:13:31.650
But that foolish son-in-law...

00:13:32.735 --> 00:13:36.822
He not only left Shinto
priesthood but also.

00:13:37.156 --> 00:13:40.033
Play politics? He's hopeless.

00:13:40.034 --> 00:13:42.453
Have one more, my man.

00:13:45.414 --> 00:13:47.707
I'm counting on your help again.

00:13:47.708 --> 00:13:49.417
Leave it to me.

00:13:49.418 --> 00:13:53.046
You'll get votes from the Kadoiri
and Sakagami Districts.

00:13:53.047 --> 00:13:54.505
How's it going with her?

00:13:54.506 --> 00:13:56.258
It's not that easy.

00:13:58.135 --> 00:14:00.262
I smell corruption.

00:14:00.345 --> 00:14:01.847
Don't be ridiculous.

00:14:02.473 --> 00:14:04.849
Bring us a few more hot sake.

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:06.100
OK.

00:14:06.101 --> 00:14:08.770
Katsuhiko, come help on site this weekend.

00:14:08.771 --> 00:14:10.897
Learn how to use explosives.

00:14:10.898 --> 00:14:12.148
Yes.

00:14:12.149 --> 00:14:13.316
Can't hear you.

00:14:13.317 --> 00:14:14.276
Yes!

00:14:27.664 --> 00:14:30.667
We both have had enough, don't we?

00:14:48.852 --> 00:14:51.854
Is that Yotsuha? She's all grown up.

00:14:51.855 --> 00:14:54.525
They're both pretty like their mother.

00:14:56.318 --> 00:14:57.402
Hey.

00:14:57.653 --> 00:14:59.029
Hey.

00:15:30.936 --> 00:15:33.480
It's the oldest sake in the world.

00:15:34.064 --> 00:15:36.691
By chewing on rice, spitting it out,

00:15:36.692 --> 00:15:39.485
and letting it ferment, it becomes alcohol.

00:15:39.486 --> 00:15:41.071
"Kuchikamisake."

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:44.574
Do the gods appreciate sake made that way?

00:15:44.575 --> 00:15:46.243
Of course they do.

00:15:48.328 --> 00:15:50.747
Hey, look. It's Miyamizu.

00:15:56.378 --> 00:15:58.713
Oh! I could never do that!

00:15:58.714 --> 00:16:00.381
Isn't she embarrassed?

00:16:00.382 --> 00:16:02.092
I can't believe it.

00:16:16.356 --> 00:16:18.775
Cheer up, Mitsuha.

00:16:19.109 --> 00:16:21.611
Who cares if a few classmates saw you?

00:16:21.612 --> 00:16:24.531
I envy your "pre-pubescent"
carefree attitude.

00:16:24.907 --> 00:16:28.159
Why not sell lots of kuchikamisake and

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.785
use the money to go to Tokyo?

00:16:29.786 --> 00:16:32.330
Where do you get such ideas?

00:16:32.331 --> 00:16:35.166
Sell them with photos and making videos.

00:16:35.167 --> 00:16:38.085
Name it "Shrine Maiden's Sake."

00:16:38.086 --> 00:16:39.671
You'll make money!

00:16:40.672 --> 00:16:42.382
"Shrine Maiden's Sake"

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:45.636
No. That breaks the Liquor Tax Law.

00:16:47.262 --> 00:16:49.139
That's the problem?

00:16:54.978 --> 00:16:59.941
I hate this town! I hate this life!

00:16:59.942 --> 00:17:04.488
Please make me a handsome Tokyo boy
in my next life!

00:17:08.492 --> 00:17:10.369
What a fool...

00:17:38.313 --> 00:17:39.273
Ow!

00:17:42.067 --> 00:17:44.111
Ouch...

00:17:52.703 --> 00:17:53.870
Where...

00:18:05.257 --> 00:18:08.051
Something's there...

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.565
Ow!

00:18:22.566 --> 00:18:24.359
Taki, Are you up?

00:18:26.611 --> 00:18:28.821
It was your turn to cook.

00:18:28.822 --> 00:18:29.989
Wake up on time.

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:31.533
I'm sorry.

00:18:32.784 --> 00:18:36.079
I'm going now. Drink all the miso soup.

00:18:36.455 --> 00:18:37.289
OK.

00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:40.082
Go to school even if you're late.

00:18:40.083 --> 00:18:41.209
See you.

00:18:42.336 --> 00:18:43.670
Have a nice day.

00:18:55.015 --> 00:18:56.475
What a strange dream.

00:18:58.101 --> 00:19:00.479
"From Tsukasa: Run, you're late!"

00:19:01.938 --> 00:19:06.443
What? Who's it from? Tsukasa? Who's that?

00:19:16.119 --> 00:19:17.913
I have to use the bathroom.

00:19:26.797 --> 00:19:28.507
This is too realistic.

00:20:18.932 --> 00:20:19.975
"Shinjuku Station"

00:20:39.619 --> 00:20:41.746
I'm in Tokyo.

00:20:46.209 --> 00:20:47.377
"Jingu High School"

00:20:48.712 --> 00:20:50.671
- Where'd you get it?
- Daikanyama.

00:20:50.672 --> 00:20:52.590
The front act at the next gig...

00:20:52.591 --> 00:20:55.510
Let's skip club and go to a movie.

00:21:00.348 --> 00:21:01.808
Taki!

00:21:03.143 --> 00:21:06.980
Arriving at noon, huh? Let's eat lunch.

00:21:07.397 --> 00:21:08.939
You ignored my message

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:10.816
Oh, Tsukasa?

00:21:10.817 --> 00:21:13.612
At least you sound apologetic.

00:21:15.447 --> 00:21:16.864
You got lost?

00:21:16.865 --> 00:21:17.865
Yeah.

00:21:17.866 --> 00:21:21.535
How could you get lost
on the way to school?

00:21:21.536 --> 00:21:25.206
- Uh... Well... I (watashi)...
- Feminine?

00:21:25.207 --> 00:21:26.708
I (watakushi)!

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:28.376
I (boku)?

00:21:29.002 --> 00:21:30.045
I (ore)?

00:21:32.214 --> 00:21:34.340
I was enjoying myself.

00:21:34.341 --> 00:21:38.011
It's so festive to me all in Tokyo.

00:21:38.386 --> 00:21:40.388
You seem to have a dialect.

00:21:40.889 --> 00:21:42.098
Where's your lunch?

00:21:42.807 --> 00:21:45.518
- Geez.
- Are you half asleep?

00:21:45.519 --> 00:21:46.644
You got something?

00:21:46.645 --> 00:21:48.688
Croquette-egg sandwich sounds good!

00:21:52.943 --> 00:21:54.110
Thank you.

00:21:56.363 --> 00:21:57.863
Let's go to a cafe.

00:21:57.864 --> 00:22:00.200
Oh that one? OK. Corning, Taki?

00:22:00.575 --> 00:22:03.619
What? What? What?

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:04.621
A cafe?

00:22:08.333 --> 00:22:10.000
Nice timberwork up there.

00:22:10.001 --> 00:22:11.962
Yeah, they attented to details.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:13.964
Taki, have you decided?

00:22:15.173 --> 00:22:18.259
What? I could live for a month

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:19.636
for the price of this!

00:22:19.803 --> 00:22:22.388
What age are you from again?

00:22:22.389 --> 00:22:26.184
Hmm. Oh well. It's a dream anyway.

00:22:32.774 --> 00:22:34.025
What a great dream.

00:22:40.031 --> 00:22:43.285
Oh no, what should I do? I'm late for work!

00:22:43.743 --> 00:22:45.203
Your shift is today?

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.539
- Go, then.
- Oh, yeah.

00:22:48.915 --> 00:22:51.543
Oh! Urn...

00:22:52.252 --> 00:22:54.796
Where do I work?

00:22:55.338 --> 00:22:56.590
What?

00:23:02.554 --> 00:23:04.598
Tables 6, 7, and 10 are waiting!

00:23:05.181 --> 00:23:06.849
Table 12! Taki!

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:08.183
Yes.

00:23:08.184 --> 00:23:09.727
Here you go.

00:23:09.728 --> 00:23:12.730
Uh, zucchini and tomato salad...

00:23:12.731 --> 00:23:14.315
We didn't order that.

00:23:14.316 --> 00:23:16.817
Taki, I said no more truffles!

00:23:16.818 --> 00:23:18.736
Taki, can't hear you!

00:23:18.737 --> 00:23:19.821
Taki!

00:23:21.197 --> 00:23:23.700
When is this dream going to end?

00:23:32.125 --> 00:23:34.293
Hey. Hey waiter.

00:23:34.294 --> 00:23:35.629
Oh, yes?

00:23:37.756 --> 00:23:40.634
There was a toothpick in the pizza.

00:23:41.468 --> 00:23:44.054
We could have gotten hurt.

00:23:44.512 --> 00:23:46.765
Good that I noticed earlier.

00:23:47.599 --> 00:23:48.642
What do you have to say?

00:23:49.392 --> 00:23:51.102
Uh, well...

00:23:51.603 --> 00:23:52.646
But...

00:23:53.021 --> 00:23:55.732
There are no toothpicks
in an Italian restaurant's...

00:23:57.484 --> 00:23:58.526
Excuse me.

00:23:59.361 --> 00:24:00.987
Is everything ok?

00:24:02.072 --> 00:24:03.531
I'll handle this.

00:24:04.866 --> 00:24:06.660
What's wrong with you today?

00:24:07.952 --> 00:24:09.663
Please accept our apologies.

00:24:09.954 --> 00:24:11.413
Your meal is on the house.

00:24:11.414 --> 00:24:12.415
Oh, really?

00:24:12.624 --> 00:24:14.584
I hope you weren't hurt.

00:24:25.303 --> 00:24:26.553
Urn...

00:24:26.554 --> 00:24:27.721
Okudera...

00:24:27.722 --> 00:24:28.890
Ms. Okudera.

00:24:29.641 --> 00:24:31.809
Ms. Okudera. Thank you...

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:33.352
A stroke of bad luck today.

00:24:33.353 --> 00:24:34.478
No, uh...

00:24:34.479 --> 00:24:36.189
It definitely was a set-up.

00:24:36.564 --> 00:24:39.109
Handled it according to the manual, but...

00:24:40.276 --> 00:24:42.862
Oh, Ms. Okudera, your skirt!

00:24:44.531 --> 00:24:45.572
You OK?

00:24:45.573 --> 00:24:47.534
- What happened?
- It is slashed.

00:24:47.867 --> 00:24:49.661
That jerk from earlier?

00:24:49.911 --> 00:24:51.955
Now what? Do you remember his face?

00:24:52.038 --> 00:24:52.914
No.

00:24:53.581 --> 00:24:54.999
Come with me.

00:24:55.709 --> 00:24:56.793
Hey, Taki!

00:24:58.086 --> 00:24:59.462
Take off your skirt.

00:24:59.671 --> 00:25:02.298
Oh! I'll look the other way!

00:25:06.469 --> 00:25:08.012
This won't take long.

00:25:12.767 --> 00:25:13.810
Done!

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:19.065
Wow, Taki! It looks better than before!

00:25:20.775 --> 00:25:24.362
Thank you for saving me today.

00:25:25.905 --> 00:25:29.409
Actually, I was concerned about you.

00:25:29.659 --> 00:25:32.495
You're weak but quick-tempered.

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.331
I like you better today.

00:25:36.082 --> 00:25:39.335
Never knew you had a feminine side.

00:25:40.754 --> 00:25:43.214
"JR Yamanote Line: 7 min."

00:25:50.263 --> 00:25:53.475
What a realistic dream...

00:25:57.896 --> 00:26:00.565
Oh, he keeps a diary.

00:26:05.028 --> 00:26:06.362
He's so organized.

00:26:07.071 --> 00:26:09.073
Wish I lived in Tokyo too.

00:26:12.368 --> 00:26:14.913
Oh! That's her!

00:26:19.626 --> 00:26:21.377
A crush, maybe?

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.385
"Walked to the station
with Ms. Okudera after work,

00:26:30.386 --> 00:26:33.807
thanks to my feminine powers!"

00:26:35.058 --> 00:26:36.601
"Who are you?"

00:26:45.568 --> 00:26:50.740
"Mitsuha"

00:27:05.171 --> 00:27:06.672
What is this?

00:27:06.673 --> 00:27:07.715
"Mitsuha"

00:27:11.177 --> 00:27:13.804
Wha... Wha...

00:27:13.805 --> 00:27:15.014
What's going on?

00:27:15.098 --> 00:27:16.057
"Thanks to my feminine powers!"

00:27:17.225 --> 00:27:18.642
Let's go to a cafe again.

00:27:18.643 --> 00:27:21.228
Sorry, I have to go to work.

00:27:21.229 --> 00:27:23.398
Do you remember where to go?

00:27:25.316 --> 00:27:29.028
Tsukasa, did you prank my phone and...

00:27:29.612 --> 00:27:32.448
Oh, never mind. See you.

00:27:33.741 --> 00:27:36.451
He's acting normal today.

00:27:36.452 --> 00:27:39.162
Yesterday he was kind of cute.

00:27:39.163 --> 00:27:40.498
What?

00:27:42.792 --> 00:27:44.918
Wha... What?

00:27:44.919 --> 00:27:47.337
Taki, you tried to outdo us!

00:27:47.338 --> 00:27:49.257
You walked home with her!

00:27:51.759 --> 00:27:54.386
Did I really? With MS. Okudera?

00:27:54.387 --> 00:27:55.930
What happened afterwards?

00:27:57.348 --> 00:27:59.392
I don't really remember.

00:27:59.475 --> 00:28:00.894
Oh really, now?

00:28:01.477 --> 00:28:03.730
Corning through.

00:28:04.856 --> 00:28:07.317
- Hi guys.
- Hello.

00:28:08.026 --> 00:28:09.569
Let's make this a good one.

00:28:10.069 --> 00:28:12.238
Right, Taki?

00:28:21.664 --> 00:28:23.333
"Mitsuha? Who are you?"

00:28:23.458 --> 00:28:24.667
"What are you?"

00:28:25.585 --> 00:28:28.754
You're not touching your boobs today.

00:28:28.755 --> 00:28:31.591
Breakfast is ready! Hurry up!

00:28:34.469 --> 00:28:35.929
Boobs?

00:28:38.014 --> 00:28:39.599
Morning.

00:28:45.438 --> 00:28:48.315
Why is everyone staring at me?

00:28:48.316 --> 00:28:51.735
Well you made quite a scene yesterday.

00:28:51.736 --> 00:28:52.946
Huh?

00:28:53.947 --> 00:28:54.822
"Still life drawing"

00:28:54.823 --> 00:28:56.990
Did you see the election posters?

00:28:56.991 --> 00:28:58.700
Doesn't matter who wins.

00:28:58.701 --> 00:29:00.410
It's all about how to serve up the grants.

00:29:00.411 --> 00:29:03.498
Shh! Someone's livelihood depends on it.

00:29:04.582 --> 00:29:07.000
They mean me, right?

00:29:07.001 --> 00:29:08.628
Well, yeah.

00:29:09.504 --> 00:29:11.047
Hey, Mitsuha!

00:29:20.682 --> 00:29:25.770
Wha... Wha... I did what?

00:29:28.147 --> 00:29:29.482
Mitsuha?

00:29:36.572 --> 00:29:39.117
Is this... Could this be...

00:29:41.452 --> 00:29:44.287
Could this be that we're really...

00:29:44.288 --> 00:29:47.207
In our dreams, that guy and I have...

00:29:47.208 --> 00:29:49.794
In our dreams, that girl and I have...

00:29:51.004 --> 00:29:52.672
switched places?

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:11.274
At last, hello you've opened your eyes

00:30:11.774 --> 00:30:16.237
But, why won't you even look me in
the eyes, what't wrong with you?

00:30:17.447 --> 00:30:21.284
You angrily tell me that I'm late

00:30:21.993 --> 00:30:26.205
Well, I'm sorry, but I did my best
and running at my fastest pace

00:30:26.497 --> 00:30:29.875
I started to understand what's going on.

00:30:29.876 --> 00:30:33.253
Taki is a boy my age living in Tokyo.

00:30:33.254 --> 00:30:36.381
I switch with Mitsuha at random,

00:30:36.382 --> 00:30:38.801
a few times a week unexpectedly.

00:30:39.177 --> 00:30:40.720
Sleep triggers it.

00:30:40.887 --> 00:30:41.637
The cause is a mystery.

00:30:41.637 --> 00:30:42.513
"Condition: Sleep?
Cause: Unknown"

00:30:42.764 --> 00:30:44.723
My memory during the switch is hazy

00:30:44.724 --> 00:30:47.893
after I wake up.

00:30:47.894 --> 00:30:51.313
But we've definitely switched places.

00:30:51.314 --> 00:30:55.025
The reactions of the people
around us is the proof. So...

00:30:55.026 --> 00:30:58.528
So we need to lay down some rules

00:30:58.529 --> 00:30:59.405
to protect each other's lifestyles.

00:30:59.405 --> 00:31:00.281
"Strictly forbidden!"

00:31:00.448 --> 00:31:02.115
Things to watch out during the switch

00:31:02.116 --> 00:31:03.034
"No baths! No looking! No touching!"

00:31:03.117 --> 00:31:04.327
and a list of "don'ts."

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:05.411
"Don't waste money! No dialect!
Don't be late!"

00:31:05.536 --> 00:31:09.415
We also agreed to leave reports
in our smartphones.

00:31:09.749 --> 00:31:14.420
To work together to tide over this
mysterious phenomenon.

00:31:14.796 --> 00:31:18.049
But...

00:31:18.257 --> 00:31:20.383
- That girl!
- That guy!

00:31:20.384 --> 00:31:25.138
Back in the Zenzenzense 'til this day,
been looking everywhere for you

00:31:25.139 --> 00:31:30.477
I followed the sound of your innocent
laughter and it guided me in the right way

00:31:30.478 --> 00:31:35.023
Even if every piece of you disappeared,
and if it scattered everywhere

00:31:35.024 --> 00:31:37.652
Guys are staring! Watch the skirt!

00:31:37.735 --> 00:31:39.028
Come on, this is basic!

00:31:39.153 --> 00:31:39.946
"Careful With skirts!"

00:31:42.782 --> 00:31:44.699
Stop wasting my money!

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.368
It's YOUR body eating.

00:31:46.369 --> 00:31:47.537
And I'm working too!

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:48.454
"Braided cords..."

00:31:48.621 --> 00:31:49.830
Braided cords... I can't do this!

00:31:49.831 --> 00:31:51.748
You work too many shifts!

00:31:51.749 --> 00:31:53.708
It's because you waste my money!

00:31:53.709 --> 00:31:57.255
I wonder if we can push our way through

00:31:58.089 --> 00:32:02.468
The countless barriers that's waiting
in the future just beyond our view

00:32:03.803 --> 00:32:07.723
Side by side, no way we can lose

00:32:08.224 --> 00:32:12.687
We'll beat destiny at its own game
and make it follow our own rules

00:32:13.729 --> 00:32:16.481
Grabbed coffee with Ms. Okudera.

00:32:16.482 --> 00:32:18.191
You two have a good thing going!

00:32:18.192 --> 00:32:21.820
Mitsuha, stop changing my relationships!

00:32:21.821 --> 00:32:25.407
Taki, why is a girl in love with me?

00:32:25.408 --> 00:32:27.994
You're more popular when I'm you.

00:32:28.077 --> 00:32:28.870
"Don't think too much of yourself!"

00:32:29.036 --> 00:32:30.036
Don't think too much of yourself!

00:32:30.037 --> 00:32:31.204
You don't even have a girlfriend!

00:32:31.205 --> 00:32:32.497
You don't have a boyfriend!

00:32:32.498 --> 00:32:33.958
- I...
- I...

00:32:34.125 --> 00:32:34.834
- "Fool"
- "Idiot"

00:32:34.835 --> 00:32:37.003
I'm single because I want it!

00:32:58.316 --> 00:33:00.026
I feel bad doing this to her

00:33:04.071 --> 00:33:06.656
You sure do like your boobs.

00:33:06.657 --> 00:33:09.577
We're going now! Get ready!

00:33:11.704 --> 00:33:12.954
Comet Tiamat has become visible

00:33:12.955 --> 00:33:16.208
to the naked eye for a few days now.

00:33:16.209 --> 00:33:18.001
When and where can it be seen?

00:33:18.002 --> 00:33:18.878
"Comet Tiamat Reaching Perigee"

00:33:19.045 --> 00:33:21.713
Comet Tiamat is moving from east to west

00:33:21.714 --> 00:33:24.591
as if to follow the sun.

00:33:24.592 --> 00:33:26.635
So it can be seen above Venus...

00:33:26.636 --> 00:33:28.679
Why do you wear uniform?

00:33:36.395 --> 00:33:41.525
Grandma, why is the body of
our shrine's god so far away?

00:33:41.943 --> 00:33:45.445
I don't know. It is because of Mayugoro.

00:33:45.446 --> 00:33:46.613
Who's that?

00:33:46.614 --> 00:33:48.532
What? He's famous!

00:33:56.707 --> 00:33:58.542
Here, Grandma.

00:34:03.297 --> 00:34:05.091
Whoa, Mitsuha.

00:34:16.477 --> 00:34:18.645
Mitsuha, Yotsuha,

00:34:18.646 --> 00:34:20.856
do you know "Musubi"?

00:34:21.065 --> 00:34:22.065
Musubi?

00:34:22.066 --> 00:34:27.321
Musubi is the old way of calling
the local guardian god.

00:34:27.613 --> 00:34:30.408
This word has profound meaning.

00:34:31.117 --> 00:34:33.910
It means "Tying thread"

00:34:33.911 --> 00:34:36.746
And it also means "Connecting people".

00:34:36.747 --> 00:34:39.458
And "The flow of time".

00:34:39.834 --> 00:34:42.128
These are all god's power.

00:34:43.045 --> 00:34:46.172
So the braided cords that we make

00:34:46.173 --> 00:34:48.133
are the god's art

00:34:48.134 --> 00:34:51.679
which represent the flow of time itself.

00:34:52.471 --> 00:34:55.390
They converge and take shape.

00:34:55.391 --> 00:34:57.934
They twist, tangle

00:34:57.935 --> 00:34:59.602
sometimes unravel, break,

00:34:59.603 --> 00:35:01.856
then connect again.

00:35:03.024 --> 00:35:06.944
Musubi is knotting. That's time.

00:35:09.864 --> 00:35:11.114
Drink.

00:35:11.115 --> 00:35:12.325
Thank you.

00:35:13.534 --> 00:35:15.076
I want some too!

00:35:15.077 --> 00:35:17.663
That's also Musubi.

00:35:18.456 --> 00:35:21.166
Whether it be water, rice, or sake

00:35:21.167 --> 00:35:23.418
when a person consumes something and

00:35:23.419 --> 00:35:26.880
it joins their soul, that's Musubi.

00:35:26.881 --> 00:35:29.507
So today's offering

00:35:29.508 --> 00:35:34.847
is an important custom that
connects the god and people.

00:35:36.682 --> 00:35:38.225
Hey, I see it!

00:35:41.645 --> 00:35:46.400
That's the body of Miyamizu Shrine's god?

00:36:03.376 --> 00:36:06.337
Beyond this point is "kakuriyo."

00:36:07.129 --> 00:36:09.590
It means the underworld.

00:36:10.174 --> 00:36:11.634
It's the underworld!

00:36:15.012 --> 00:36:17.055
In exchange for returning to this world,

00:36:17.056 --> 00:36:19.641
you must leave behind

00:36:19.642 --> 00:36:22.103
what is most important to you.

00:36:23.854 --> 00:36:25.773
The kuchikamisake.

00:36:27.024 --> 00:36:28.858
The kuchikamisake?

00:36:28.859 --> 00:36:32.779
You'll offer it to the god's body.

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:36.075
It's half of you.

00:36:37.368 --> 00:36:39.578
Half of Mitsuha...

00:36:57.805 --> 00:36:59.723
It's twilight-"kataware-doki"  already.

00:37:00.266 --> 00:37:02.226
Kataware-doki?

00:37:12.611 --> 00:37:13.778
Oh yeah,

00:37:13.779 --> 00:37:15.698
maybe I can see the comet.

00:37:16.782 --> 00:37:18.409
The comet?

00:37:19.118 --> 00:37:20.035
Oh,

00:37:20.536 --> 00:37:22.370
Mitsuha,

00:37:22.371 --> 00:37:25.791
you're dreaming right now, aren't you?

00:37:37.011 --> 00:37:40.473
Tears? Why?

00:37:41.765 --> 00:37:43.851
"I'm almost there. Looking forward to it!"

00:37:44.852 --> 00:37:48.355
Ms. Okudera? What's she talking about?

00:37:49.565 --> 00:37:51.358
What did Mitsuha do this time?

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:54.236
A date?

00:38:01.744 --> 00:38:05.246
A date with Ms. Okudera tomorrow!

00:38:05.247 --> 00:38:07.625
Meet at 10:30 a.m. at the station!

00:38:08.959 --> 00:38:12.046
Was what I'd planned, but...

00:38:26.393 --> 00:38:27.645
Taki.

00:38:29.063 --> 00:38:30.480
Sorry. Did you wait long?

00:38:30.481 --> 00:38:33.943
Yes. No... Um...

00:38:42.618 --> 00:38:44.077
I just got here.

00:38:44.078 --> 00:38:46.872
Good. Let's go.

00:38:47.998 --> 00:38:51.669
He's so lucky. They must
be together around now...

00:38:55.756 --> 00:38:56.715
Hey?

00:39:00.719 --> 00:39:02.096
I...

00:39:03.222 --> 00:39:04.765
Why?

00:39:11.021 --> 00:39:13.606
I wanted to go to this date,

00:39:13.607 --> 00:39:16.568
but if it so happens that you

00:39:16.569 --> 00:39:19.029
end up going, you better enjoy it!

00:39:23.325 --> 00:39:27.788
However, I'm sure you've
never gone out for a date before,

00:39:29.748 --> 00:39:31.874
I don't know what to say...

00:39:31.875 --> 00:39:33.293
so below are some links

00:39:33.294 --> 00:39:36.255
to help you out, you late bloomer.

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:37.673
Really?

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:39.174
"You can get a girlfriend too!"

00:39:40.634 --> 00:39:42.677
"I suffer anxiety but got a girl!

00:39:42.678 --> 00:39:43.804
"The dos and don'ts of texting."

00:39:45.139 --> 00:39:47.140
She's making fun of me.

00:39:47.141 --> 00:39:50.185
"Photo exhibition: Nostalgia"

00:40:16.045 --> 00:40:17.880
Taki...

00:40:18.464 --> 00:40:21.675
You're like a different person today.

00:40:31.894 --> 00:40:35.104
Um, Ms. Okudera. Are you hungry?

00:40:35.105 --> 00:40:36.440
How about dinner...

00:40:37.733 --> 00:40:39.401
Let's call it a day.

00:40:41.278 --> 00:40:42.446
Yes.

00:40:42.738 --> 00:40:46.617
Taki, you... Sorry if I'm wrong.

00:40:47.493 --> 00:40:51.580
You used to have a bit
of a crush on me, right?

00:40:52.456 --> 00:40:55.626
But now you like someone else.

00:40:57.336 --> 00:40:59.212
No I don't!

00:40:59.213 --> 00:41:00.296
Really?

00:41:00.297 --> 00:41:02.965
No! That's not true at all.

00:41:02.966 --> 00:41:04.551
I wonder.

00:41:06.011 --> 00:41:08.388
Oh well. Thanks for today.

00:41:08.389 --> 00:41:09.848
See you at work.

00:41:23.987 --> 00:41:25.905
By the time the date is over,

00:41:25.906 --> 00:41:30.369
the comet will be visible in the sky.

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:35.082
What is she saying?

00:41:38.794 --> 00:41:41.463
"Mitsuha Miyamizu"

00:42:03.777 --> 00:42:06.530
Oh, it's you, Tessie.

00:42:07.531 --> 00:42:10.909
No, I just didn't feel
like going, that's all.

00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:12.411
I'm fine.

00:42:13.162 --> 00:42:16.707
What? The festival? Well...

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:22.296
Oh yeah, the comet.
Today's it show the peak of its brightness

00:42:23.547 --> 00:42:26.383
OK, got it. Later, then.

00:42:28.552 --> 00:42:31.929
You just want to see her in a yukata.

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:34.056
What I? No!

00:42:34.057 --> 00:42:35.893
I didn't even think about it.

00:42:38.061 --> 00:42:40.271
Hey, she sounded kind of upset.

00:42:40.272 --> 00:42:42.315
Because she didn't want to listen to
your phone call?

00:42:42.316 --> 00:42:43.649
May be she is annoyed by you.

00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:44.650
Sorry I'm late.

00:42:44.651 --> 00:42:45.944
- Here she is!
- Finally!

00:42:47.738 --> 00:42:51.408
- Your... your...
- Oh! What happened, Mitsuha?

00:42:52.409 --> 00:42:53.911
Your hair!

00:42:54.828 --> 00:42:57.623
Looks kinda funny, I guess?

00:43:06.173 --> 00:43:08.758
Is it because of that boy?

00:43:08.759 --> 00:43:09.801
Ditched, maybe?

00:43:09.802 --> 00:43:13.054
Why do guys associate
cutting hair with breakups?

00:43:13.055 --> 00:43:15.306
She said she just felt like it.

00:43:15.307 --> 00:43:16.849
Really?

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:18.851
She just felt like cutting
off that much hair?

00:43:18.852 --> 00:43:21.980
Oh! Hey! You can see it!

00:43:40.249 --> 00:43:42.334
Wow!

00:44:00.686 --> 00:44:06.316
The number you have called
is not available...

00:44:08.861 --> 00:44:11.445
I'll tell her about this disastrous date

00:44:11.446 --> 00:44:14.240
next time we switch,

00:44:14.241 --> 00:44:17.286
I thought. But...

00:44:17.578 --> 00:44:19.830
For some reason, after that,

00:44:20.539 --> 00:44:24.251
Mitsuha and I never switched places again.

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:01.830
"Mountains in Gifu Prefecture"

00:45:13.675 --> 00:45:14.885
"Hida mountains"

00:46:17.698 --> 00:46:22.202
What... What are you doing here?

00:46:25.038 --> 00:46:27.332
Tsukasa told me and here I am!

00:46:31.378 --> 00:46:32.713
Tsukasa, I asked you to cover for me

00:46:33.338 --> 00:46:36.924
at home and at work.

00:46:36.925 --> 00:46:38.551
Takagi will cover your shift.

00:46:38.552 --> 00:46:41.763
Leave it to me! But you owe me a meal!

00:46:42.055 --> 00:46:43.681
This isn't funny.

00:46:43.682 --> 00:46:46.142
- We were worried about you.
- Huh?

00:46:46.143 --> 00:46:47.393
You can't go alone.

00:46:47.394 --> 00:46:49.353
What if it's a con act?

00:46:49.354 --> 00:46:50.604
A con act?

00:46:50.605 --> 00:46:52.982
You're meeting an online friend.

00:46:52.983 --> 00:46:55.401
Well no, not exactly...

00:46:55.402 --> 00:46:57.904
- I think he's using a dating site.
- No!

00:46:58.488 --> 00:47:01.115
You've been acting weird lately.

00:47:01.116 --> 00:47:02.283
We'll keep an eye on you.

00:47:02.284 --> 00:47:04.202
I'm not a kid!

00:47:06.246 --> 00:47:08.039
The switching stopped.

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:10.542
My calls and texts didn't go through.

00:47:11.501 --> 00:47:15.213
So I decided to go see Mitsuha in person.

00:47:16.256 --> 00:47:19.259
I wanted to meet her. But...

00:47:20.969 --> 00:47:24.138
What? You don't know where?

00:47:24.139 --> 00:47:26.474
The town's scenery is your only clue?

00:47:26.475 --> 00:47:27.476
Yes.

00:47:30.145 --> 00:47:31.855
And you can't contact her?

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:33.689
What's this all about?

00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:36.525
Seriously. What a lousy tour planner.

00:47:36.526 --> 00:47:37.902
I did not plan a tour!

00:47:37.903 --> 00:47:41.031
Oh well. We'll help you look for her.

00:47:41.364 --> 00:47:43.950
Oh how cute! Look!

00:47:44.618 --> 00:47:45.659
So annoying.

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:47.162
Oh, it moved!

00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:17.983
So it's impossible after all...

00:48:17.984 --> 00:48:21.863
What? After all the
trouble we went through?

00:48:24.658 --> 00:48:27.160
You haven't done anything.

00:48:30.247 --> 00:48:33.415
A Takayama ramen.

00:48:33.416 --> 00:48:35.251
Oh, then a Takayama ramen.

00:48:35.252 --> 00:48:38.672
- OK. 3 ramens.
- OK.

00:48:40.507 --> 00:48:42.967
Can we return to Tokyo today?

00:48:42.968 --> 00:48:46.220
We could be cutting it close. I'll check.

00:48:46.221 --> 00:48:47.180
Thanks.

00:48:47.181 --> 00:48:49.474
Are you all right with that?

00:48:52.144 --> 00:48:56.189
I'm starting to feel like
I'm barking up the wrong tree.

00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:04.197
Why young man, that's Itomori, isn't it?

00:49:05.574 --> 00:49:09.035
It's a very good drawing. Isn't it, dear?

00:49:10.453 --> 00:49:14.039
Yeah, it's Itomori. Brings back memories.

00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:16.458
He was born in Itomori.

00:49:16.459 --> 00:49:17.502
Itomori...

00:49:19.588 --> 00:49:22.006
Yes! Itomori Town! That's it!

00:49:22.007 --> 00:49:24.633
It's nearby, isn't it?

00:49:24.634 --> 00:49:27.636
- What are you...
- Itomori was...

00:49:27.637 --> 00:49:30.306
Itomori? No way!

00:49:30.307 --> 00:49:32.684
Is it where that comet...

00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:47.490
"Keep Out"

00:50:22.484 --> 00:50:25.819
Hey. Is this really the place?

00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:29.532
No way! Taki must remember wrong.

00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:33.370
No. I'm sure it is the place.

00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:36.497
This schoolyard. The mountains.

00:50:36.498 --> 00:50:39.500
I remember this high school clearly!

00:50:39.501 --> 00:50:41.502
That can't be true!

00:50:41.503 --> 00:50:44.421
Surely you remember that disaster

00:50:44.422 --> 00:50:46.258
that took hundreds of lives 3 years ago!

00:50:47.384 --> 00:50:48.927
Died?

00:50:49.761 --> 00:50:53.056
Died 3 years ago?

00:50:54.975 --> 00:50:56.600
That can't be.

00:50:56.601 --> 00:51:00.647
I still have the memos
that she left behind...

00:51:18.081 --> 00:51:19.416
They're disappearing...

00:51:29.092 --> 00:51:30.384
Comet Tiamat,

00:51:30.385 --> 00:51:31.970
with an orbital period of 1,200 years,

00:51:32.095 --> 00:51:32.887
"Itomori, the Town that Vanished"

00:51:32.971 --> 00:51:36.099
made a close approach to Earth
3 years ago in October.

00:51:36.266 --> 00:51:37.017
"Meteor Strikes, Wipes out Town"

00:51:37.018 --> 00:51:38.685
Nobody predicted that its nucleus

00:51:38.977 --> 00:51:40.437
would split at its perigee.

00:51:42.188 --> 00:51:43.939
"Town Annihilated"

00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:45.566
"Over 500 dead or missing"

00:51:45.567 --> 00:51:46.984
"Itomori, the Town that Vanished"

00:51:46.985 --> 00:51:48.527
"October 4, 2013-Itomori vanished."

00:51:48.528 --> 00:51:51.113
A fragment of the comet became

00:51:51.114 --> 00:51:52.197
a meteor that struck Japan.

00:51:52.198 --> 00:51:54.283
"Itomori, comet, damage"

00:51:54.284 --> 00:51:58.121
It was the day of the autumn festival.

00:51:58.455 --> 00:52:00.623
The point of impact was here.

00:52:01.416 --> 00:52:05.544
At 8:42 p.m., it struck where people

00:52:05.545 --> 00:52:06.713
were gathered for the festival.

00:52:09.090 --> 00:52:10.841
"List of the Names of Victims"

00:52:10.842 --> 00:52:13.093
Over 500 people died,

00:52:13.094 --> 00:52:15.179
a third of the town's population,

00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:19.017
and now nobody lives in Itomori anymore.

00:52:26.816 --> 00:52:30.236
Tessie and Sayaka...

00:52:31.613 --> 00:52:34.365
"Mitsuha Miyamizu"

00:52:34.366 --> 00:52:35.825
That's her?

00:52:36.451 --> 00:52:38.452
It has to be some kind of mistake.

00:52:38.453 --> 00:52:41.455
This person died 3 years ago!

00:52:41.456 --> 00:52:44.083
Just 2, 3 weeks ago, she said to me

00:52:44.084 --> 00:52:47.836
that the comet would be visible.

00:52:47.837 --> 00:52:48.921
So...

00:52:48.922 --> 00:52:50.090
You're dreaming now...

00:52:51.257 --> 00:52:52.217
I...

00:52:52.218 --> 00:52:54.010
Aren't you?

00:52:54.803 --> 00:52:56.012
I...

00:52:58.098 --> 00:52:59.349
What did I...

00:53:13.696 --> 00:53:15.697
Lively up there.

00:53:15.698 --> 00:53:18.325
I'm sorry we could only get one room.

00:53:18.326 --> 00:53:19.994
No problem.

00:53:20.912 --> 00:53:21.954
How's Taki?

00:53:21.955 --> 00:53:25.249
He's still reading articles on Itomori.

00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:27.209
Newspapers and magazines

00:53:27.210 --> 00:53:29.212
at the time at random it seems.

00:53:33.716 --> 00:53:35.134
What?

00:53:35.135 --> 00:53:37.428
Nothing. I didn't know you smoke.

00:53:37.429 --> 00:53:40.557
Oh. I quit recently, but...

00:53:41.516 --> 00:53:44.769
What do you think about Taki's story?

00:53:47.897 --> 00:53:50.024
I liked him.

00:53:50.608 --> 00:53:54.778
The way he was recently. He was always

00:53:54.779 --> 00:53:56.406
a nice guy, but even more so lately.

00:53:56.948 --> 00:54:00.410
Like he was trying so hard. It was cute.

00:54:01.578 --> 00:54:05.582
What he's saying doesn't
make sense to me...

00:54:07.959 --> 00:54:11.128
But I'm sure he met someone

00:54:11.129 --> 00:54:13.339
and that someone changed him.

00:54:14.883 --> 00:54:17.051
That much is for sure, I think.

00:54:17.177 --> 00:54:18.136
"Worst-ever Itomori Cornet Disaster"

00:54:31.608 --> 00:54:34.068
It was all just a dream.

00:54:35.403 --> 00:54:37.779
I recognized the scenery because

00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:41.367
I remembered the news from 3 years ago.

00:54:42.368 --> 00:54:45.871
If not that, then... a ghost?

00:54:45.872 --> 00:54:50.835
No... Was I fantasizing?

00:54:54.547 --> 00:54:58.676
Her name... What was it?

00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:03.889
Tsukasa went to take a bath.

00:55:03.890 --> 00:55:06.559
Oh, Ms. Okudera.

00:55:06.643 --> 00:55:10.897
I, uh... I've been saying
such strange things.

00:55:11.564 --> 00:55:13.733
Thank you for coming along today.

00:55:17.362 --> 00:55:18.779
No problem.

00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:20.697
"Tatara Iron Making Site"

00:55:20.698 --> 00:55:22.199
"Braided Cords of Itomori"

00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:24.744
Braided cords. How pretty.

00:55:25.328 --> 00:55:28.414
Is that a braided cord you're wearing?

00:55:29.374 --> 00:55:35.462
Oh, this... I think someone
gave it to me a long time ago.

00:55:35.463 --> 00:55:39.217
I wear it sometimes as
kind of a lucky charm...

00:55:41.594 --> 00:55:42.637
Who was it?

00:55:44.931 --> 00:55:48.141
Why don't you go take a bath, too?

00:55:48.142 --> 00:55:49.978
Yes... No.

00:55:52.897 --> 00:55:57.651
Someone who makes braided
cords told me before...

00:55:57.652 --> 00:56:00.321
The cords represent the
flow of time itself.

00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:04.075
The threads twist, tangle,

00:56:04.492 --> 00:56:07.996
unravel, and connect again. That's time...

00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:10.582
Maybe at that place...

00:56:28.349 --> 00:56:29.517
"Around here?"

00:56:36.441 --> 00:56:37.567
Taki.

00:56:38.610 --> 00:56:39.944
Taki.

00:56:40.778 --> 00:56:42.322
Taki.

00:56:43.448 --> 00:56:45.700
Don't you remember me?

00:56:59.631 --> 00:57:00.964
"I have to go somewhere.

00:57:00.965 --> 00:57:01.924
"Return to Tokyo without me.

00:57:02.091 --> 00:57:03.216
"I'll return later.

00:57:03.217 --> 00:57:04.010
"Thanks."

00:57:07.972 --> 00:57:09.140
Taki...

00:57:33.122 --> 00:57:35.750
Eat this up there.

00:57:36.459 --> 00:57:40.630
Your drawing of Itomori... It was good.

00:58:17.625 --> 00:58:20.128
They converge and take shape.

00:58:20.545 --> 00:58:22.504
They twist, tangle,

00:58:22.505 --> 00:58:24.381
sometimes unravel,

00:58:24.382 --> 00:58:26.342
then connect again...

00:58:27.218 --> 00:58:32.181
Musubi-knotting. That's time.

00:58:42.108 --> 00:58:43.151
There it is!

00:58:45.403 --> 00:58:47.196
It's really there!

00:58:48.531 --> 00:58:51.492
It wasn't just a dream!

00:59:21.773 --> 00:59:24.484
From here is the underworld.

00:59:47.882 --> 00:59:50.510
It's the sake we brought.

00:59:51.886 --> 00:59:55.097
This is her sister's, and this is mine.

00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.144
Before the comet struck...

01:00:00.978 --> 01:00:05.483
So the Mitsuha I know is from 3 years ago?

01:00:06.776 --> 01:00:10.446
Our timelines weren't in sync.

01:00:11.489 --> 01:00:13.658
Half of her...

01:00:28.339 --> 01:00:29.715
Musubi.

01:00:31.092 --> 01:00:33.719
If time can really be turned back,

01:00:34.971 --> 01:00:36.389
give me one last chance...

01:00:51.153 --> 01:00:52.572
A comet!

01:01:57.803 --> 01:02:01.223
Your name is Mitsuha.

01:02:07.396 --> 01:02:09.898
You're both my treasures.

01:02:09.899 --> 01:02:12.192
You're a big sister now.

01:02:12.193 --> 01:02:14.070
"Get well soon, Mom."

01:02:14.862 --> 01:02:17.531
I'm so sorry, my dears.

01:02:18.908 --> 01:02:22.328
Dad, when is Morn going to come home?

01:02:23.537 --> 01:02:24.746
I couldn't save her.

01:02:24.747 --> 01:02:26.873
Get a hold of yourself!

01:02:26.874 --> 01:02:28.375
Who cares about the shrine?

01:02:28.376 --> 01:02:30.001
You're the adopted son-in-law!

01:02:30.002 --> 01:02:31.671
I loved my wife Futaba.

01:02:32.129 --> 01:02:33.254
Not Miyamizu Shrine.

01:02:33.255 --> 01:02:34.924
Get out of here!

01:02:37.051 --> 01:02:39.844
Mitsuha, Yotsuha,

01:02:39.845 --> 01:02:42.848
you'll be with Grandma from now on.

01:02:47.603 --> 01:02:49.312
- Who am I?
- "Who are you?"

01:02:49.313 --> 01:02:50.647
- No, who are you?
- "Mitsuha"

01:02:50.648 --> 01:02:51.315
"Fool"

01:02:51.316 --> 01:02:52.440
Don't think too much of yourself.

01:02:52.441 --> 01:02:53.943
You don't even have a girlfriend

01:02:54.110 --> 01:02:57.446
He's so lucky. They must
be together around now...

01:02:59.156 --> 01:03:00.365
I...

01:03:00.366 --> 01:03:01.700
I'm going to Tokyo.

01:03:01.701 --> 01:03:03.369
What? Hey, Mitsuha!

01:03:05.871 --> 01:03:09.792
Grandma, could you do me a favor?

01:03:10.584 --> 01:03:13.212
Oh yeah, the comet.

01:03:13.713 --> 01:03:16.798
Today's the peak of its brightness...

01:03:16.799 --> 01:03:19.343
Mitsuha! Don't stay there!

01:03:19.844 --> 01:03:24.598
Mitsuha, get out of there
before the comet strikes!

01:03:26.809 --> 01:03:28.769
Mitsuha, get out of there!

01:03:29.562 --> 01:03:31.772
Mitsuha! Mitsuha!

01:03:32.189 --> 01:03:34.442
Mitsuha!

01:03:52.418 --> 01:03:55.755
I'm Mitsuha! She's still alive!

01:04:06.432 --> 01:04:09.101
Mitsuha, are you touching...

01:04:11.062 --> 01:04:12.813
My sister!

01:04:14.982 --> 01:04:17.026
Yotsuha!

01:04:20.071 --> 01:04:22.615
Mitsuha has finally lost it.

01:04:23.032 --> 01:04:25.576
I'm leaving without her.

01:04:25.826 --> 01:04:27.911
She's lost it.

01:04:27.912 --> 01:04:30.538
She's completely lost it.

01:04:30.539 --> 01:04:31.791
Scary.

01:04:32.041 --> 01:04:36.544
Comet Tiamat has been visible
to the naked eye for a few days now.

01:04:36.545 --> 01:04:40.507
Tonight it will finally reach
its perigee around 7:40 p.m.,

01:04:40.508 --> 01:04:43.259
and will achieve its maximum brightness.

01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:46.055
It's tonight. There's still time.

01:04:46.806 --> 01:04:48.599
Good morning, Mitsuha.

01:04:49.016 --> 01:04:50.101
Oh...

01:04:51.227 --> 01:04:54.355
You're not Mitsuha, are you?

01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:58.275
You knew, Grandma?

01:04:58.692 --> 01:05:05.407
No, but watching the way you behaved lately
triggered some memories.

01:05:06.158 --> 01:05:08.327
I also remember seeing strange dreams

01:05:08.619 --> 01:05:11.705
when I was a young girl.

01:05:12.706 --> 01:05:15.542
Although now I've forgotten about

01:05:15.543 --> 01:05:18.504
whose life I was dreaming about.

01:05:19.171 --> 01:05:20.421
Forgotten...

01:05:20.422 --> 01:05:22.340
Treasure the experience.

01:05:22.341 --> 01:05:25.511
Dreams fade away after you wake up.

01:05:25.970 --> 01:05:28.555
There were times your mother and I

01:05:28.556 --> 01:05:30.599
had similar experiences.

01:05:31.475 --> 01:05:35.521
Maybe those dreams that
the Miyamizu people had

01:05:35.813 --> 01:05:38.732
were all for what will happen today.

01:05:39.233 --> 01:05:41.360
Grandma, listen.

01:05:41.819 --> 01:05:45.197
A comet will strike Itomori tonight

01:05:45.698 --> 01:05:46.866
and everyone will die.

01:05:54.081 --> 01:05:55.958
"Nobody will believe that"?

01:05:56.542 --> 01:05:59.170
What a surprisingly
ordinary reply, Grandma.

01:05:59.879 --> 01:06:02.339
I won't let them die!

01:06:03.257 --> 01:06:05.925
Oh! What happened, Mitsuha?

01:06:05.926 --> 01:06:10.471
Your... your hair!

01:06:10.472 --> 01:06:13.057
Oh, this. It looked better before, huh?

01:06:13.058 --> 01:06:14.684
Oh, that's it?

01:06:14.685 --> 01:06:17.478
Forget that! If nothing is done,

01:06:17.479 --> 01:06:18.772
everyone will die tonight!

01:06:21.108 --> 01:06:23.569
So we have to do something!

01:06:28.073 --> 01:06:29.991
Why aren't you at school?

01:06:29.992 --> 01:06:34.955
Uh... We have to save the town.

01:06:36.248 --> 01:06:37.582
The community wireless system?

01:06:37.583 --> 01:06:40.251
Yeah, those speakers you see everywhere.

01:06:40.252 --> 01:06:43.172
"Superimposition, frequency"

01:06:44.715 --> 01:06:46.926
I see! That could work!

01:06:47.259 --> 01:06:48.760
You're awesome, Tessie!

01:06:48.761 --> 01:06:51.304
Hey! Don't come so close!

01:06:51.305 --> 01:06:53.640
What, embarrassed? Hey, hey!

01:06:53.641 --> 01:06:56.769
Stop! You're a girl of marriageable age!

01:06:57.186 --> 01:06:58.853
"Club Discontinued-Keep Out"

01:06:58.854 --> 01:07:01.649
You're such a nice guy!

01:07:04.902 --> 01:07:07.195
Got them. Here's your change.

01:07:07.196 --> 01:07:08.613
Sorry, Sayaka.

01:07:08.614 --> 01:07:10.156
It's all right.

01:07:10.157 --> 01:07:13.202
- What a cheap fee.
- Deal with it.

01:07:14.453 --> 01:07:16.329
What about you?

01:07:16.330 --> 01:07:18.499
Have you come up with an escape plan?

01:07:21.794 --> 01:07:24.796
What? A bomb?

01:07:24.797 --> 01:07:26.965
We have water gel explosives

01:07:26.966 --> 01:07:29.259
for construction at our storage site.

01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:31.010
Broadcast hijacking?

01:07:31.011 --> 01:07:32.845
The town's wireless system can be easily

01:07:32.846 --> 01:07:35.848
jacked using the startup frequency.

01:07:35.849 --> 01:07:37.850
So we can broadcast an evacuation

01:07:37.851 --> 01:07:40.061
warning from the school.

01:07:40.062 --> 01:07:42.480
The school is outside the disaster area,

01:07:42.481 --> 01:07:44.858
so people can evacuate here.

01:07:45.401 --> 01:07:48.069
It's... It's totally a crime!

01:07:48.070 --> 01:07:49.737
You do the broadcast.

01:07:49.738 --> 01:07:50.738
Why?

01:07:50.739 --> 01:07:52.157
You're in the broadcast club.

01:07:52.491 --> 01:07:54.242
I'm in charge of explosives.

01:07:54.243 --> 01:07:56.537
I'll go talk to the mayor.

01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:58.830
In the end, the city council

01:07:58.831 --> 01:08:00.790
has to evacuate everyone.

01:08:00.791 --> 01:08:03.960
I'm his daughter. I can persuade him.

01:08:03.961 --> 01:08:05.796
It's a perfect plan.

01:08:07.256 --> 01:08:10.008
Oh, whatever.

01:08:10.009 --> 01:08:12.135
It's just a what-if fantasy, isn't it?

01:08:12.136 --> 01:08:14.429
What? Well...

01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:16.015
Not necessarily!

01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:18.183
Do you know how Lake Itomori was formed?

01:08:18.267 --> 01:08:18.934
"A meteor crater lake
formed 1,200 years ago."

01:08:19.101 --> 01:08:20.685
It's a meteor crater!

01:08:20.686 --> 01:08:24.605
So one did strike this
area a thousand years ago!

01:08:24.606 --> 01:08:26.774
Oh! So that's why...

01:08:26.775 --> 01:08:29.945
You're right, Tessie!

01:08:32.364 --> 01:08:34.992
Let's do it together!

01:08:38.287 --> 01:08:40.873
What on earth are you talking about?

01:08:42.833 --> 01:08:46.252
I said we have to evacuate everyone

01:08:46.253 --> 01:08:47.921
- in town before tonight or...
- Shut your mouth.

01:08:53.594 --> 01:08:55.971
"The comet will split and strike the town"?

01:08:56.055 --> 01:08:56.972
"Itomori Town Hall"

01:08:57.222 --> 01:08:59.391
"Over 500 people will die"?

01:09:00.225 --> 01:09:03.145
How dare you spout such nonsense?

01:09:03.729 --> 01:09:06.899
If you're serious, then you're sick.

01:09:07.232 --> 01:09:10.152
Madness must be from the Miyamizu side.

01:09:11.445 --> 01:09:15.074
I'll get someone to drive you
to a hospital in the city.

01:09:16.033 --> 01:09:20.079
I'll listen to you after
a doctor examines you.

01:09:23.082 --> 01:09:25.209
You son of a...

01:09:33.092 --> 01:09:36.637
Mitsuha! No...

01:09:37.554 --> 01:09:38.639
Who...

01:09:40.391 --> 01:09:42.101
Who are you?

01:09:56.031 --> 01:09:58.282
See you later at the festival.

01:09:58.283 --> 01:10:00.118
Let's meet at the shrine.

01:10:00.119 --> 01:10:01.327
- Don't be late.
- Bye!

01:10:01.328 --> 01:10:02.955
- See you.
- Later.

01:10:04.456 --> 01:10:05.874
You shouldn't go!

01:10:06.375 --> 01:10:09.001
Get out of town. Tell your friends.

01:10:09.002 --> 01:10:10.294
What are you saying?

01:10:10.295 --> 01:10:11.421
Mitsuha!

01:10:11.422 --> 01:10:14.090
- What was that?
- Let's go.

01:10:14.091 --> 01:10:16.009
What are you doing?

01:10:16.885 --> 01:10:18.803
Could Mitsuha...

01:10:18.804 --> 01:10:21.055
Could she have persuaded them?

01:10:21.056 --> 01:10:22.474
Is it my fault?

01:10:22.891 --> 01:10:26.645
Yotsuha, leave town with
Grandma before nightfall.

01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:28.729
You'll die if you stay here!

01:10:28.730 --> 01:10:30.815
What are you saying?

01:10:30.816 --> 01:10:33.234
Yesterday you suddenly went to Tokyo.

01:10:33.235 --> 01:10:35.571
What's wrong with you?

01:10:37.072 --> 01:10:38.323
Tokyo?

01:10:38.574 --> 01:10:41.243
Hey, Mitsuha!

01:10:43.454 --> 01:10:45.497
How did it go with your old man?

01:10:47.708 --> 01:10:49.293
Hey, Mitsuha?

01:10:49.918 --> 01:10:51.419
What's wrong with her?

01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:52.463
No idea.

01:11:02.639 --> 01:11:04.433
Are you there?

01:11:05.225 --> 01:11:07.894
Is something over there?

01:11:07.895 --> 01:11:09.437
Let me use your bike.

01:11:09.438 --> 01:11:10.605
Hey, what the...

01:11:10.606 --> 01:11:11.773
Hey, Mitsuha!

01:11:13.066 --> 01:11:14.442
What about our plan?

01:11:14.443 --> 01:11:16.861
Get ready as planned!

01:11:16.862 --> 01:11:18.071
Please!

01:11:44.139 --> 01:11:47.226
I'm Taki again.

01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:53.148
What's Taki doing here?

01:12:02.241 --> 01:12:03.534
The town...

01:12:04.201 --> 01:12:05.536
is gone.

01:12:15.003 --> 01:12:18.549
At that moment... did I...

01:12:21.969 --> 01:12:23.554
die?

01:12:33.272 --> 01:12:36.567
Taki. Taki.

01:12:38.694 --> 01:12:40.946
Don't you remember me?

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.084
I'm going to Tokyo.

01:12:55.085 --> 01:12:56.836
What? Now?

01:12:56.837 --> 01:12:58.421
Why?

01:12:58.422 --> 01:12:59.630
A date.

01:12:59.631 --> 01:13:01.882
You have a boyfriend in Tokyo?

01:13:01.883 --> 01:13:04.177
Not my date.

01:13:05.345 --> 01:13:07.097
I'll come home tonight.

01:13:10.017 --> 01:13:12.059
If I suddenly showed up,

01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:15.063
would I bother him? Surprise him?

01:13:15.522 --> 01:13:18.775
He might not like it.

01:13:25.866 --> 01:13:29.619
The number you are trying to call
is not available...

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:31.204
There's no way we could meet.

01:13:31.663 --> 01:13:33.790
But what if we did?

01:13:34.583 --> 01:13:37.461
What should I do? Would I annoy him?

01:13:37.878 --> 01:13:38.837
Would it be awkward?

01:13:38.838 --> 01:13:39.838
"Tiamat Makes Closest Approach Tomorrow"

01:13:39.839 --> 01:13:41.840
Or maybe...

01:13:42.883 --> 01:13:45.802
he'd be a bit glad to see me?

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:50.849
The number you've called
is not available...

01:13:51.725 --> 01:13:54.144
There's no way we could meet.

01:13:55.145 --> 01:13:56.355
But...

01:13:57.939 --> 01:14:00.442
one thing is certain.

01:14:01.318 --> 01:14:05.405
If we see each other, we'll know.

01:14:06.156 --> 01:14:09.076
That you were the one who was inside me.

01:14:10.369 --> 01:14:13.080
That I was the one who was inside you.

01:14:13.497 --> 01:14:14.539
I'm sorry.

01:14:46.321 --> 01:14:47.614
Excuse me.

01:15:20.105 --> 01:15:21.565
That time 3 years ago,

01:15:21.898 --> 01:15:24.276
before I got to know you...

01:15:27.863 --> 01:15:29.072
Taki.

01:15:30.323 --> 01:15:31.408
Taki.

01:15:33.452 --> 01:15:34.661
Taki.

01:15:35.912 --> 01:15:37.664
Urn... It's me.

01:15:40.208 --> 01:15:42.502
Don't you remember me?

01:15:43.795 --> 01:15:45.297
Who are you?

01:15:50.177 --> 01:15:51.470
I'm sorry.

01:15:59.269 --> 01:16:00.812
But he's Taki.

01:16:01.938 --> 01:16:03.273
Weird girl.

01:16:03.774 --> 01:16:08.153
This is Yotsuya Station.

01:16:12.532 --> 01:16:13.575
Hey!

01:16:14.618 --> 01:16:16.077
What's your name?

01:16:16.745 --> 01:16:17.829
Mitsuha!

01:16:18.246 --> 01:16:20.624
My name is Mitsuha!

01:16:27.714 --> 01:16:32.719
That time 3 years ago, you came...

01:16:33.428 --> 01:16:35.055
to see me!

01:16:46.233 --> 01:16:47.442
Taki?

01:16:55.867 --> 01:16:58.745
Mitsuha!

01:16:58.912 --> 01:17:00.121
Taki?

01:17:14.469 --> 01:17:16.263
Mitsuha!

01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:20.350
You're here, aren't you? Inside my body!

01:17:20.892 --> 01:17:22.269
Taki!

01:17:22.894 --> 01:17:25.188
Taki, where are you?

01:17:25.772 --> 01:17:26.940
It's Mitsuha.

01:17:27.357 --> 01:17:29.276
I can hear her, but...

01:17:30.318 --> 01:17:33.654
Taki, where are you?

01:17:33.655 --> 01:17:35.073
Taki!

01:17:47.836 --> 01:17:50.338
Taki, are you...

01:17:51.548 --> 01:17:53.008
there?

01:18:17.657 --> 01:18:19.534
It's twilight-"kataware-doki."

01:18:34.507 --> 01:18:35.675
Mitsuha.

01:18:41.973 --> 01:18:43.224
Taki.

01:18:44.643 --> 01:18:48.480
Taki. It's really you.

01:18:52.108 --> 01:18:53.275
Taki!

01:18:53.276 --> 01:18:55.153
I came to see you.

01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:57.821
It wasn't easy because

01:18:57.822 --> 01:18:59.865
you were so far away.

01:18:59.866 --> 01:19:04.870
But how? At that moment, I...

01:19:04.871 --> 01:19:07.374
I drank your kuchikamisake.

01:19:11.378 --> 01:19:13.588
You drank that?

01:19:14.631 --> 01:19:16.174
You idiot! Pervert!

01:19:16.841 --> 01:19:19.927
Oh yeah, and you touched my boobs!

01:19:19.928 --> 01:19:22.012
How do you know that?

01:19:22.013 --> 01:19:23.681
Yotsuha saw it.

01:19:23.682 --> 01:19:26.308
Oh! Sorry, I couldn't help it!

01:19:26.309 --> 01:19:27.477
It was just once.

01:19:27.602 --> 01:19:29.062
Just once?

01:19:31.356 --> 01:19:33.274
Doesn't matter how many times! Jerk.

01:19:33.942 --> 01:19:34.901
Sorry.

01:19:35.235 --> 01:19:37.529
Oh, this...

01:19:37.904 --> 01:19:42.033
Oh. Really, Why'd you come see me
before I knew you?

01:19:42.575 --> 01:19:44.035
There's no way I'd recognize you.

01:19:44.494 --> 01:19:48.081
Here. I kept it for 3 years.

01:19:48.999 --> 01:19:51.292
Now you keep it.

01:19:52.293 --> 01:19:53.420
Yes.

01:20:01.469 --> 01:20:02.554
How is it?

01:20:03.763 --> 01:20:04.973
Not bad.

01:20:05.515 --> 01:20:06.890
You're lying!

01:20:06.891 --> 01:20:09.309
No, I... Sorry.

01:20:09.310 --> 01:20:11.521
You're really so...

01:20:24.492 --> 01:20:28.121
Mitsuha, you still have things to do.
Listen.

01:20:31.374 --> 01:20:32.333
It's coming.

01:20:32.917 --> 01:20:35.377
Don't worry. You've still got time.

01:20:35.378 --> 01:20:37.547
Yes, I'll try.

01:20:39.674 --> 01:20:42.009
Kataware-doki is almost...

01:20:42.010 --> 01:20:43.428
over.

01:20:45.263 --> 01:20:49.059
Hey, Mitsuha.
So we don't forget when we wake up...

01:20:53.813 --> 01:20:57.400
Let's write our names on each other. Here.

01:20:59.110 --> 01:21:00.153
OK!

01:21:09.496 --> 01:21:10.705
Mitsuha?

01:21:13.041 --> 01:21:14.751
Hey, Mitsuha?

01:21:23.676 --> 01:21:25.553
I wanted to tell you.

01:21:27.388 --> 01:21:29.807
Wherever you are in the world,

01:21:29.808 --> 01:21:32.102
I'll search for you.

01:21:35.814 --> 01:21:37.982
Your name is Mitsuha.

01:21:39.859 --> 01:21:41.945
It's OK. I remember.

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:44.822
Mitsuha. Mitsuha. Mitsuha.

01:21:44.823 --> 01:21:46.240
Your name is Mitsuha.

01:21:46.241 --> 01:21:47.700
Your name is...

01:21:58.294 --> 01:22:01.464
Who are you?

01:22:03.716 --> 01:22:06.636
Why did I come here?

01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:10.431
I came here to see her.

01:22:10.807 --> 01:22:14.519
To save her. I wanted her to be alive.

01:22:15.103 --> 01:22:17.146
Who was it? Who?

01:22:17.147 --> 01:22:18.523
Who did I come to see?

01:22:20.150 --> 01:22:22.401
Someone dear to me. I don't want to forget.

01:22:22.402 --> 01:22:24.154
I shouldn't forget!

01:22:25.446 --> 01:22:29.909
Who? Who? Who? Who?

01:22:30.410 --> 01:22:31.995
What's your name?

01:22:33.246 --> 01:22:40.919
Caught in a never-ending game. Seems
like the world's still trying to tame me

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:47.134
If that's the way I will obey.
Beautifully struggle everyday

01:22:47.135 --> 01:22:50.554
Taki. Taki. Taki.

01:22:50.555 --> 01:22:54.267
It's OK. I remember. I'll never forget!

01:22:54.767 --> 01:22:56.769
Taki. Taki.

01:22:57.228 --> 01:23:00.356
Your name is Taki!

01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:12.619
"Itomori Substation"

01:23:15.079 --> 01:23:16.039
Tessie!

01:23:16.372 --> 01:23:19.083
Mitsuha! Where've you been?

01:23:19.167 --> 01:23:21.377
He said sorry for breaking your bike.

01:23:22.170 --> 01:23:24.255
- Huh? Who did?
- I did.

01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:27.634
Explain everything to me later.

01:23:32.013 --> 01:23:34.765
That's going to fall? Really?

01:23:34.766 --> 01:23:37.143
Yes! Saw it with my own eyes!

01:23:37.977 --> 01:23:39.479
What? You saw it, huh?

01:23:39.687 --> 01:23:41.856
Then I guess we got no choice.

01:23:42.523 --> 01:23:44.984
Now we're both criminals!

01:23:46.027 --> 01:23:47.070
"Broadcasting Room"

01:23:47.779 --> 01:23:49.738
What? I really have to do it?

01:23:49.739 --> 01:23:53.660
When the town's power goes out,

01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:55.912
the equipment there should work on backup.

01:23:56.329 --> 01:23:57.663
Please, Sayaka!

01:23:57.664 --> 01:23:59.581
Repeat it as much as you can!

01:23:59.582 --> 01:24:02.293
Woo-hoo! You can do it!

01:24:02.710 --> 01:24:04.879
Oh, to heck with it!

01:24:12.136 --> 01:24:13.428
Soon, you think?

01:24:13.429 --> 01:24:14.764
I've no idea!

01:24:25.149 --> 01:24:26.650
What was that?

01:24:26.651 --> 01:24:28.194
Look over there

01:24:29.529 --> 01:24:36.077
At an unprecedented speed
I will drive right into you

01:24:36.786 --> 01:24:40.622
And when I dozed off into
a lukewarm can of soda

01:24:40.623 --> 01:24:44.543
I dreamed of a world so far from here,
that's not on the map

01:24:44.544 --> 01:24:48.089
Searching outside of the classroom window

01:24:48.381 --> 01:24:53.845
or in summer morning that's
brought from the commuting train

01:24:54.178 --> 01:24:55.805
Hey. look!

01:25:05.273 --> 01:25:09.359
This is Itomori Town Hall.

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:12.237
An explosion has occurred
at the substation.

01:25:12.238 --> 01:25:13.697
- An accident?
- An explosion?

01:25:13.698 --> 01:25:18.160
There is danger of further explosions
and forest fires.

01:25:18.161 --> 01:25:21.079
Residents in the following areas,

01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:23.750
please evacuate to Itomori High School.

01:25:24.792 --> 01:25:29.422
Kadoiri District, Sakagami District,

01:25:29.839 --> 01:25:31.965
The broadcast isn't from here?

01:25:31.966 --> 01:25:33.133
Who is it, then?

01:25:33.134 --> 01:25:35.011
Miyamori District...

01:25:35.970 --> 01:25:37.680
Oyazawa District...

01:25:38.723 --> 01:25:40.600
Let's go, Mitsuha!

01:25:41.517 --> 01:25:43.895
Tessie!

01:25:49.901 --> 01:25:52.235
Run, everyone! Forest fire!

01:25:52.236 --> 01:25:54.614
Forest fire! Please evacuate!

01:25:55.156 --> 01:25:56.449
Run! Fire!

01:25:56.532 --> 01:25:59.577
It's not safe here! Please evacuate!

01:26:00.787 --> 01:26:03.581
We don't have enough time! Mitsuha!

01:26:05.208 --> 01:26:06.376
What's wrong?

01:26:07.126 --> 01:26:11.047
His name... I can't remember his name.

01:26:13.883 --> 01:26:15.509
Look, I don't know.

01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:17.178
You started all this!

01:26:17.970 --> 01:26:20.598
We can't evacuate everyone by ourselves!

01:26:21.015 --> 01:26:23.476
Go persuade your father!

01:26:31.734 --> 01:26:35.029
Everyone run! Go to the high school!

01:26:37.698 --> 01:26:39.450
Oh, Mitsuha.

01:26:42.328 --> 01:26:44.496
It's no terrorist attack!

01:26:44.497 --> 01:26:45.664
What's Chubu Electric saying?

01:26:45.665 --> 01:26:46.916
They're still checking!

01:26:47.291 --> 01:26:50.794
No forest fire yet? Are you sure?

01:26:50.795 --> 01:26:51.796
OK!

01:26:53.214 --> 01:26:54.881
Stop this broadcast!

01:26:54.882 --> 01:26:56.884
Figure out where it's coming from!

01:26:57.218 --> 01:27:00.012
The Takayama sensor station called!

01:27:00.888 --> 01:27:02.265
The high school?

01:27:02.723 --> 01:27:06.351
Again, residents in the following areas,

01:27:06.352 --> 01:27:08.812
evacuate to Itomori High School... Oh!

01:27:08.813 --> 01:27:11.524
What are you doing? Turn that off!

01:27:13.568 --> 01:27:14.609
Sayaka!

01:27:14.610 --> 01:27:16.028
Oh no.

01:27:19.323 --> 01:27:22.243
What have you done, Sayaka!

01:27:25.621 --> 01:27:28.499
This is Itomori Town Hall.

01:27:29.709 --> 01:27:32.837
We are currently checking on the accident.

01:27:33.713 --> 01:27:36.465
Please don't panic and stay

01:27:36.466 --> 01:27:38.925
where you are for further notice.

01:27:38.926 --> 01:27:40.719
Stay put, they said.

01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:41.721
What's going on?

01:27:41.804 --> 01:27:43.014
So we stay put?

01:27:43.931 --> 01:27:46.267
Come on, you should all evacuate!

01:27:46.976 --> 01:27:49.060
The high school is the shelter!

01:27:49.061 --> 01:27:50.480
Katsuhiko!

01:27:53.524 --> 01:27:56.027
What are you doing?

01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:00.781
Sorry, Mitsuha.

01:28:02.116 --> 01:28:03.367
It's over.

01:28:05.786 --> 01:28:09.373
It's really splitting apart!

01:28:16.088 --> 01:28:17.839
- Look at that!
- Wow!

01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:20.967
Please look! The comet has split in two

01:28:20.968 --> 01:28:22.802
and meteors are falling!

01:28:22.803 --> 01:28:25.555
Nobody predicted this.

01:28:25.556 --> 01:28:27.224
We have a mystical view here.

01:28:27.225 --> 01:28:29.184
So the comet's nucleus split?

01:28:29.185 --> 01:28:30.685
Did tidal forces affect...

01:28:30.686 --> 01:28:32.729
The comet isn't within the Roche limit

01:28:32.730 --> 01:28:35.524
so the nucleus itself must have...

01:28:35.525 --> 01:28:38.235
In the past, Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9

01:28:38.236 --> 01:28:41.071
broke and collided with Jupiter in 1994.

01:28:41.072 --> 01:28:42.572
At least 21 fragments...

01:28:42.573 --> 01:28:44.074
I have to go there look!

01:28:44.075 --> 01:28:45.200
Is it dangerous?

01:28:45.201 --> 01:28:48.912
They will probably melt
before reaching the ground

01:28:48.913 --> 01:28:51.122
and the probability of a meteor crashing

01:28:51.123 --> 01:28:53.250
into a residential area is small...

01:28:53.251 --> 01:28:54.960
To predict the trajectory...

01:28:54.961 --> 01:28:56.962
To be witnessing such a magnificent

01:28:56.963 --> 01:28:58.463
celestial event, and...

01:28:58.464 --> 01:29:01.341
That we're witnessing this live

01:29:01.342 --> 01:29:03.593
is extremely fortunate

01:29:03.594 --> 01:29:05.721
for those of us living in this age.

01:29:08.224 --> 01:29:11.435
Hey. Who are you?

01:29:15.439 --> 01:29:17.275
Who? Who?

01:29:17.692 --> 01:29:19.110
Who is that?

01:29:19.735 --> 01:29:22.696
Someone dear to me. I shouldn't forget.

01:29:22.697 --> 01:29:24.490
I didn't want to forget!

01:29:25.866 --> 01:29:29.912
Who? Who? Who are you?

01:29:30.871 --> 01:29:32.498
What's your name?

01:29:39.380 --> 01:29:40.715
It's broken!

01:30:00.318 --> 01:30:03.695
So we don't forget when we wake up,

01:30:03.696 --> 01:30:05.406
let's write our names on each other.

01:30:13.831 --> 01:30:15.749
"I love you"

01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:22.632
Even the way that you loved.
I swear I could smell the scent of yours.

01:30:23.466 --> 01:30:30.431
And in the way that you walked.
I could hear that bright laughter of yours.

01:30:32.350 --> 01:30:38.855
I can't remember your name with this...

01:30:38.856 --> 01:30:42.776
Make sure that
it's burned into the back of my eyes.

01:30:42.777 --> 01:30:50.200
It's not a right that I'm due,
my duty that is must have been kept.

01:30:50.201 --> 01:30:51.535
Dad!

01:30:53.371 --> 01:30:55.164
- Mitsuha!
- Mitsuha!

01:30:55.498 --> 01:30:57.291
Not you again...

01:31:01.462 --> 01:31:04.757
It was almost as if it
were a scene from a dream.

01:31:05.174 --> 01:31:08.969
Nothing more, nothing less
than a beautiful view.

01:31:09.428 --> 01:31:17.686
Words like 'tomorrow' or 'future or 'fate',
no matter how far they extend their hands.

01:31:17.687 --> 01:31:25.402
We breathe, we dream, we raise our love, in
a timeless land that is far out of reach.

01:31:25.403 --> 01:31:33.201
Even the second, hour hands of the clock, they
look at us sideways as they tick and took.

01:31:33.202 --> 01:31:40.500
How I hope to have forever to spend.
This life, no - all future lives

01:31:40.501 --> 01:31:47.633
right here in this world with you.

01:32:40.853 --> 01:32:46.817
What am I doing here?

01:32:56.827 --> 01:33:00.790
The next station is Yoyogi.

01:33:12.968 --> 01:33:16.347
Please mind the door.

01:33:19.183 --> 01:33:22.936
I'm always searching for something.

01:33:22.937 --> 01:33:27.066
This feeling has possessed
me for some time.

01:33:28.943 --> 01:33:30.902
I applied because...

01:33:30.903 --> 01:33:32.487
The landscapes people live in...

01:33:32.488 --> 01:33:34.531
To build a city's landscape...

01:33:34.532 --> 01:33:36.115
You never know when Tokyo

01:33:36.116 --> 01:33:37.617
might disappear as well.

01:33:37.618 --> 01:33:40.411
So I want to help build landscapes that

01:33:40.412 --> 01:33:44.792
leave heartwarming memories...

01:33:46.919 --> 01:33:49.254
How many interviews have you had?

01:33:49.255 --> 01:33:50.421
I haven't kept track.

01:33:50.422 --> 01:33:52.924
- Can't see you landing a job.
- Thanks a lot!

01:33:52.925 --> 01:33:54.676
Maybe it's because of that suit.

01:33:54.677 --> 01:33:56.594
We're not that different!

01:33:56.595 --> 01:33:57.887
I have 2 job offers.

01:33:57.888 --> 01:33:59.098
I have 8.

01:34:02.434 --> 01:34:04.519
"LINE: You have a new message."

01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:09.900
I'm not sure if I'm

01:34:10.526 --> 01:34:13.194
searching for a person or a place,

01:34:13.195 --> 01:34:15.906
or if I'm just searching for a job.

01:34:16.782 --> 01:34:19.158
Oh, you're job-hunting?

01:34:19.159 --> 01:34:20.953
I haven't had much luck.

01:34:22.162 --> 01:34:24.247
Maybe it's because of that suit.

01:34:24.248 --> 01:34:26.208
Does it look that bad?

01:34:30.754 --> 01:34:33.256
What brings you here today?

01:34:33.257 --> 01:34:35.341
I came nearby for work

01:34:35.342 --> 01:34:38.344
so I figured I'd say hi to you.

01:34:38.345 --> 01:34:40.722
"8 years since the comet disaster"

01:34:40.723 --> 01:34:44.809
We went to Itomori once, didn't we?

01:34:44.810 --> 01:34:48.980
You were still in high school, so it was...

01:34:48.981 --> 01:34:51.025
- 5 years ago.
- That long?

01:34:51.567 --> 01:34:54.528
Seems like I've forgotten a lot.

01:34:55.654 --> 01:35:00.284
I, too, no longer remember
much from back then.

01:35:01.535 --> 01:35:03.202
Maybe we had a disagreement;

01:35:03.203 --> 01:35:06.165
the other two returned to Tokyo without me.

01:35:06.749 --> 01:35:09.835
I spent the night alone on some mountain.

01:35:10.502 --> 01:35:12.254
That's about all I remember.

01:35:14.715 --> 01:35:17.927
But at one point, I was inexplicably drawn

01:35:18.177 --> 01:35:21.305
to the events surrounding that comet.

01:35:23.641 --> 01:35:26.852
Half of a comet destroyed
a town in that disaster.

01:35:27.853 --> 01:35:30.188
But most of the town's residents

01:35:30.189 --> 01:35:31.231
were miraculously unhurt.

01:35:31.357 --> 01:35:32.650
"Evacuation of residents
to high school grounds confirmed"

01:35:32.858 --> 01:35:36.027

to be holding an emergency drill

"An unprecedented natural disaster"

01:35:36.988 --> 01:35:39.030

were outside the blast zone.

"Residents safe"

01:35:40.658 --> 01:35:41.617
"Disaster Foretold?"

01:35:41.618 --> 01:35:43.576
The sheer luck and coincidence

01:35:43.577 --> 01:35:45.286
sparked various rumors.

01:35:45.287 --> 01:35:46.454
"Mayor Miyamizu's hidden agenda"

01:35:46.455 --> 01:35:49.375
I intently read those articles back then.

01:35:49.458 --> 01:35:50.793
"Mysterious explosion at the substation"

01:35:51.835 --> 01:35:58.008
What had caught my interest so much
is now a mystery to me.

01:35:59.343 --> 01:36:03.180
I didn't even know anybody in that town.

01:36:04.723 --> 01:36:07.559
Thanks for today. This is far enough.

01:36:08.852 --> 01:36:14.316
You will be happy someday too.

01:36:17.778 --> 01:36:20.196
I feel like I'm always searching

01:36:20.197 --> 01:36:23.200
for something, for someone.

"Construction company job interview"

01:36:35.546 --> 01:36:38.673
I want to go to another bridal fair.

01:36:38.674 --> 01:36:40.508
They're all the same.

01:36:40.509 --> 01:36:42.427
Shinto-style is nice too.

01:36:42.428 --> 01:36:44.638
You wanted a wedding in a chapel.

01:36:45.472 --> 01:36:47.057
Oh, and Tessie.

01:36:47.641 --> 01:36:49.559
Lose the beard before the wedding.

01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:51.520
I'll lose 3 kg.

01:36:52.021 --> 01:36:53.856
You're eating a cake.

01:36:54.148 --> 01:36:56.150
I'll start tomorrow.

01:36:57.860 --> 01:36:59.987
Thank you for coming.

"October 4, 2013-Itomori vanished."

01:37:54.792 --> 01:37:57.211
Why does the scenery

01:37:58.212 --> 01:38:02.758
of a town that no longer exists
wring my heart so much?

01:39:22.379 --> 01:39:24.213
I was always searching...

01:39:24.214 --> 01:39:25.674
searching...

01:39:26.175 --> 01:39:27.926
for someone!

01:40:25.525 --> 01:40:27.318
Hey!

01:40:27.319 --> 01:40:30.280
Haven't we met?

01:40:40.290 --> 01:40:42.125
I thought so too!

01:40:46.630 --> 01:40:49.299
Your name is...
